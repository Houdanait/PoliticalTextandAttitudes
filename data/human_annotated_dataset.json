Such that we identified it, while we were on site of a small infant who was suffering from diarrhea illness. And under the watchful eye of well-meaning but typically adult trained clinicians, the baby lost a critical amount of weight and was severely dehydrated. Really when we identified the case, we alerted the government that this was a near miss. The child actually well <COULD> have died of a simple and treatable medical condition of dehydration. It was at that point we felt the safety of children in that facility was so impaired that we recommend that they shut down that facility. And indeed, they did."

Now the president of the United States getting ready to speak. As we stand by to hear what he has to say, Fran Townsend is here; Tom Fuentes, former assistant director of the FBI; Gloria Borger and David Gergen, our senior political analysts. We're going to have full analysis afterwards. We're also going to be able to speak with the president's deputy national security adviser, Dennis McDonough, and try to fill in some of the blanks. No doubt, the president will say a lot that will sort of cry out for more questioning. We'll hear what they have to say about all these. Most important, David Gergen, right now we want specifics.

First, we heard a decision on troops is \"weeks and weeks away.\" Then we were told there are no plans for additional troops for Afghanistan.

What they found on this occasion were two farmhouses that had nobody in. Then they found a small building, a hut building, halfway between the two farmhouses. They described it as having two rooms. One room was disorderly with clothes crumpled, lying on the floor; also brand- new clothes still in their packets. They said there was a rudimentary kitchen where there was some running water. And then as the troops were searching right <AROUND> that building, somebody noticed some soil that didn't look right on the ground, a rug that didn't look right on the floor. When they pulled back that rug -- and this was just in the dirt in the wood side by this building outdoors -- then they discovered what appeared to be a polystyrene cork, if you will, in this concrete hole. And it was in this tiny concrete hole, <ABOUT> six feet by eight feet, that Saddam Hussein was hiding. And they say that he came out without a fight, that he came out and he was looking disheveled, and very, very quickly he was taken away. So it was really the soldiers spotting that something didn't look right in the dirt on the ground, something that had been heavily camouflaged, something that had been designed to <AVOID> capture. Something General Odierno said, he said he thought there were <<PERHAPS>> 20 or 30 locations like this that Saddam Hussein <MAY> have had to go and hide in <EVERY> so <OFTEN>, Wolf."

But he was very cautious not to fire Mueller because there would be obvious political consequences, particularly during the midterm elections. So now he can say, I didn't fire Mueller. I didn't touch Mueller. I also didn't touch Rod Rosenstein. I have no issue with him following the New York Times revelation that <MAYBE> the 25th amendment being talked about or him wearing a wire. I'm just going to replace the person who made it possible that Rod Rosenstein would have his position and Mueller would have oversight by that person. And so, by putting Matthew Whitaker in the position, which by the way is not in line of succession. It would naturally go to the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, then to a solicitor general. The chief of staff or the A.G. is not the person who is supposed to be in line. And so, one has to first wonder by what authority he's going to put him there. But the president already told us he's temporary. He'll have a more permanent placement put there in the long run. So, I'm wondering if in many ways this is the president's attempt to gain information about the investigation. So, once he's downloaded everything and debriefed from Robert Mueller and then he walks away to have a permanent replacement who is Senate- confirmed come in, well, <GUESS> what Donald Trump has?

President Bush, however, says that North Korea and Iraq are very different issues. Bush says that he thinks diplomacy is going to persuade North Korea to scrap its nuclear program, but he says that Saddam Hussein refuses to come clean. Suzanne Malveaux is standing by in Crawford, Texas. We say once again happy New Year to her. And now the sun has arisen behind you -- Suzanne.",
        "statement": "Yes, happy New Year, Leon. One of President Bush's New Year's resolutions he says is to resolve these conflicts peacefully. Yesterday, at a coffeehouse in Crawford, he said when it comes to North Korea it's not a military showdown but rather a diplomatic one, that he is convinced that it can be resolved peacefully through economic and diplomatic pressure. And despite the call from Russia and South Korea for dialogue not isolation, the president is <CONFIDENT> that he'll win the support of North Korea's neighbors, those being Russia, China, South Korea and Japan. North Korea depends on its neighbors for its very survival when it comes to oil, power and food. But the president contrasted this with the situation in Iraq, saying that he doubted Saddam Hussein would comply, that Saddam Hussein came close to producing a nuclear weapon in the '90s. He <BELIEVES> that he is still making those efforts today and that he is defying the will of the international community as he has for more than a decade."

        "previous_statement": "So, Michael, the president's lawyer said multiple times, which we heard in a sound bite that Athena played us, that the president is not under investigation, only to then say in that last statement we played that it's ironic the president is being investigated by the agencies who told him to fire James Comey. So his statements are at odds with one another. What do you make of that?",
        "statement": "There is schizophrenia to what he has been saying this morning on the talk shows. As I try to divine it, there are a couple of things come to mind. First is he's saying in very legalistic terms that the president has not received a target or subject letter from Mueller, so that he is technically in legal terms not a target of criminal investigation. Fair enough. The president, <OF COURSE>, doesn't talk in legal terms, he talks in lay terms and he <FEELS> that he's under siege or under investigation, broadly speaking. Those things are not necessarily in conflict with one another. With respect to the president being -- having received advice about the firing of Comey and acting on that advice, the president said that that's not true. He said that he fired him because he had Russia on his mind and that he was going to fire him regardless of those recommendations from sessions and Comey. And, of course, it is not the Justice Department who is investigating the president now, it is the special counsel. And the reason there is a special counsel is that it would be ironic if the Justice Department were investigating him because they would have a conflict of interest. So there is no irony there because they appointed Mueller to do that which they couldn't do themselves without conflict. For all these things are confusing but when segregated, they can line up into a sensible narrative."

        "statement": "To those of you had just joining us tonight, a stunning verdict in that Tampa courtroom. Julie Schenecker has just been found guilty on the two main counts, murder one. Now this jury had a choice of multiple decisions. They <COULD> have gone with lessers such as murder two, manslaughter, voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter. They could have come back with not guilty by reason of insanity, which would have sent Julie Schenecker to a treatment facility, <POSSIBLY> for the rest of her life. But instead, they have opted to go with guilty. They have completely rejected the insanity defense by that finding. They completely rejected the theory that voluntary consumption of drugs and alcohol will equal insanity. And if you noticed, in the courtroom, Julie Schenecker sitting there as this verdict came in, completely in control of her faculties. She didn`t <SEEM> surprised by the verdict. She slowly held the Kleenex up to her face, and that`s it. There was no shaking. There was no outburst. <CLEARLY>, the woman we saw that day that was shaking at the time of the incident is not the woman we are seeing now. Was it a ruse? Was it an act for police? That we`ll never <KNOW>. But what we do know, Jane Velez, is that this jury has returned a verdict on the two most serious counts, which leads me to speculate, if the state had stuck with the death penalty, would they have given the death penalty? And there you see Schenecker again, standing at attention in the courtroom, clearly understanding what`s happening. Look at the look she`s giving the jury. If that look could kill, that jury would be just as dead as her two children. The way she is looking at them was looking at them with pure hatred, the way she looked at them. And there it goes again. It`s unmistakable Jane."

She was driving this car, with 300 kilograms of explosives, 600 pounds, rammed into this minibus, which had eight South Africans on board. And, Brooke, we were there on the scene within about an hour of the explosion. And the engine was at least 100 meters away from where the crater was, from that blast site.

Because he ensured that <SORT OF> flow over the past five years of economic and military aid from the United States to Ukraine which they have used to prosecute their war in east against the pro-Russian rebels and their diplomatic campaign as well to try and get back territories seized by Russia in Crimea in 2014.

You <KNOW>, look, I mean, in terms of his testimony we'll see what he says, and we'll be able to gauge better after that testimony <OBVIOUSLY> about (Inaudible). But Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer is attempting to argue that Kurt Volker is in on his scheme to try and get the Ukrainians to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and other issues as well like 2016 election meddling. The understanding we have of what Kurt Volker's role was as far as he is concerned, is trying to help the Ukrainians navigate the sort of conflicting difficult demands with the Trump administration was putting on the new government of Volodymyr Zelensky. So, for instance, he set up a meeting after the July 25th phone call, he set up a meeting in Madrid between Giuliani and someone called Andriy Yermak who is one of President Zelensky's closest political aide. We don't know the content of their discussion were, but our understanding is, it was to, you know, to see what it was for the Trump administration really wanted. <PERHAPS> that will come out in the testimony, that's why we're all going to be watching here in the Ukraine very closely indeed."

As you can imagine, because this is a very delicate negotiation, they're holding their cards very close to their vests as to what Mitch McConnell <MAY> be trying to demand, what Harry Reid <MIGHT> be trying to give in on. But big picture, we <KNOW> that the day started out with Harry Reid making an offer of extending the continuing resolution or the spending bill to reopen the government to about mid-December. And with regard to the debt ceiling, to extending that, raising it for the next six to nine months. That's where they started. <OF COURSE>, that didn't give Mitch McConnell and the Republicans much. Of course, he came back with something. But we're not <SURE> what that was and where things stand. We're <HOPING> to find out more very soon."

And they said they were spending too much time on television and also perhaps too much time devoted the Condit angle, and there were several other angles. So I don't know if I would agree with your characterization, but the point is, to explore the angle of Gary Condit is an important one, because this is man was intimate with a missing intern. And as we know, boyfriends, husbands are much more likely, or I think the rate for missing women, or for women who have been murdered is 50 percent of them have been killed by somebody that they know. With men it's only 25 percent.",

        "previous_statement": "Wolf, there has been tension here at the Pentagon all day about when things would begin to unfold. We are, of course, now hearing these live pictures from Baghdad air raid sirens. If things unfold in Baghdad the way they usually do, it looks like we're first seeing the first AAA antiartillery aircraft artillery possibly go off. The Iraqis have a long history in these types of events of very quickly turning on their air raid sirens looking at these live pictures, turning on their antiaircraft authority, basically shooting a wall of steel into the sky if they believe U.S. aircraft or U.S. Tomahawk missiles are coming at them. I suspect as this begins to unfold, we will see more activity in the sky. We can tell you it is a well-known fact, U.S. B-52 bombers took off from England earlier today. We are not saying their destination. We are not saying their flying time. We're not saying where they're going. They often take off on various missions. They may or may not be involved in what will unfold over Baghdad. Continuing to look at these pictures, it's not unexpected that we will continue to see air activity over Baghdad. The U.S. administration, of course -- it looks like another tracer there off to the right of your screen. The U.S. administration struggling with when to exactly begin the air bombardment of Baghdad. They had been hoping all the way along that the Iraqi military would basically revolt against the regime of Saddam Hussein, a very heavy propaganda campaign, of course, going on in the last days here, trying to convince the Iraqi military that they had no hope of winning, even rumors in the last several hours that a Republican Guard division was ready to defect. So there had been a sense of maybe waiting a bit, seeing if the Iraqi military would basically give up, seeing if the leadership would turn against Saddam Hussein. The last two nights of their airstrikes we have seen over Baghdad have, in fact, been very much aimed at leadership, military targets aimed at Saddam Hussein, his family, his top advisers. They had called them, you know, decapitation strikes, but now it looks like other things could be unfolding in the hours ahead -- Wolf.",
        "statement": "Barbara, stand by over there at the Pentagon. I want to continue to show our viewers these live pictures of Baghdad, just the last two nights <AROUND> this time, <APPROXIMATELY> just shortly after it gets dark in this part of the world, there were U.S.-led strikes, selected targets the first night, second night. Now on this third night, we anticipate there <COULD> be more activity. Clearly the Iraqi air defense systems have been on alert and the Iraqi triple air fire antiaircraft fire already being seen over the skies over Baghdad. We'll continue to show our viewers these pictures. I want to bring back CNN's Martin Savidge. He's in southern Iraq. He's still with the First Battalion 7th Marines. Marty, I assume you can't see these pictures, but tell our viewers, I interrupted you before, what you're doing, where you are and <APPROXIMATELY> what the mission is as far as you can tell from your location. Hold on, Marty. Before you start talking, let's listen a little bit to the sound of gunfire, anti-aircraft fire over the skies in Baghdad. What you're seeing is Iraqi air defense systems shooting up in the sky. They're <HOPING>, <OBVIOUSLY>, to knock down a U.S. or British plane. They're <HOPING> to knock down <PERHAPS> a cruise missile. They're firing. They have indications, presumably from their radar, that U.S., British aircraft as <WELL>, are in the skies approaching Baghdad or hovering over the skies. Let's listen a little bit more to this fire that's going on. Our military analyst David Grange, retired U.S. brigadier general, is with us as <WELL>.

        "previous_statement": "Now, the president has put Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill in charge of working with Congress on this mix of tax cuts and spending increases to try to the stimulate economy. Paul O'Neill, the treasury secretary, was here on Capitol Hill a little while ago at a hearing, outlined some of the principles. They are, first of all, a price tag. For the first time, the administration saying they would like to see a stimulus plan that would total between 60 and 75 billion dollars. They have three major components here. One, for individuals, some mix of possibly accelerated tax cuts, possibly accelerating those tax cuts that Congress has already passed. And by the way, I believe we have pictures now of the president just arriving back in the Washington area at Andrews Air Force Base, coming out of Air Force One. Again, the three major principles of this economic stimulus plan that the president is talking about. One, accelerated tax cuts for individuals to try to get consumers buying again. Also, tax cuts for businesses. And finally financial support, direct financial support for those that have been directly affected by the September 11th attacks. Now, meanwhile when Treasury Secretary O'Neill was up here on Capitol Hill -- there's Bush going into Marine One, headed back toward the White House. When the treasury secretary was up here on Capitol Hill, he said that the economy -- he sees clear signs that the economy is starting to get back on the right foot. And that's a very important point, because what we've learned about those rebate checks that went out, which were supposed to be economic stimulus checks, those $300 rebate checks that went out to individuals, is that the Treasury Department says only about 18 percent of that money was actually put back into the economy. With the economic slowdown, individuals were saving that money, not spending it: therefore, not much economic stimulus. So what Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill trying to do on Capitol Hill here is also to try to reinvigorate faith in the American economy, because without consumer confidence, all this question of economic stimulus probably won't have much effect, because individuals, not confident about the economy, may not go out and spend the economic stimulus. Much debate going on here about this as we go forward -- Judy.",

        "previous_statement": "It is a bond bonanza. Spain and Italy have hit their targets. There is rioting, curfews and political turmoil, Tunisia struggles to regain control. And Bernie made off with billions, now his victims have scored a victory. I'm Richard Quest, in good voice. And, I mean business. Good evening. A good dose of relief and easy breathing, plenty of space and lots of cash. It is just what the cash strapped Euro Zone needed today. Spain and Italy join Portugal in conducting successful fundraising exercises. The interest rates definitely hurt, but they didn't deliver the fatal blow. For now, it seems, no nation needs a bailout. It gives euro leaders vital thinking time to work out how to defend themselves against the next crisis of confidence. If you'll join me in the library, you'll see exactly how the auctions went. Let's begin with Spain, which of course was the one we were really looking at very closely. There was a five-year bond auction and they were looking to raise nearly $4 billion. The yield was at 4.54 percent. Now that is nearly 1 percentage point higher than last time around. But the good point is, of course, is that the market had been even fearing that the number would over 5 percent. If you look at the bid to cover that, the number of times it was oversubscribed. At two to one there was plenty of activity. Lots of demand for what Spain had to offer. Now, Italy is bid to cover was slightly less, although they did get the bond auction away; $4 billion of five-year bonds. In Italy's case the average yield was 3.67 percent, just up a tad on what they had to pay back in November. The $4 billion of 15-year bonds averaged 5 percent. In both cases the bid to cover ratio is 1.4 percent. And that is really very important. It means there was appetite for risk and at these sorts of levels that risk was manageable for both government and investors alike. So look at how the market reacted. Well, you don't need to be an investor genius to see Spain absolutely loved the IBEX rising, 2.6 percent. In Italy, slightly more muted. Portugal, of course, which go theirs away yesterday, that was just up a third of 1 percent. The euro did enjoy some in gains. It put on more than 1.75 percent against the dollar, at $1.33. So $1.30 has been and gone, and now comfortably into that higher range. There were other matters of course, as a result of what took place. The German finance minister, Wolfgang Shauble, says the states are working on a comprehensive package to solve the debt crisis. And that could be in place by March. Shauble doesn't think any increase in the Europe's emergency bailout fund, the Stability Fund, as you and I know it, is needed. But, of course, that would mean more German money. Steve Major is the global head of fixed income research at HSBC. He was a bit chesty himself, with a bad cold. But nonetheless, we had rates to talk about.

There has been some genuinely good news as well, because in <FACT> the EFSF <SEEMS> to be building out its scope a bit. It is being buttressed. There is a good consensus now behind the EFSF, even Germany is supporting this facility now. Also, there has been <CLEAR> evidence of fresh buying interest, mainly from Asian investors. It has been well publicized, actually, that China and Japan have been looking at it."

So it's been a shift in pattern, and yet I think once things return to normal and people wind up commuting again, the habits that they're forming now will stay with them, and it just allows for even more time for them to consume podcasts in different times and different ways in which they'll do that.",

If you look at when the election took place in Brazil--I remember when Lula was elected--Brazilians who were in this country could go to the consuls office or to the embassy to vote.

There's new concern this morning about ISIS. Attacks by U.S. soil by ISIS-inspired terrorists. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security are warning law enforcement personnel and the news media that they could be targeted by ISIS militants. Law enforcement officials tell CNN that a security bulletin with the warning is based on chatter and extremist forums and on social media. It's not on any specific threat. It is based on chatter. In Iraq, ISIS is advancing on Baghdad, despite further airstrikes over the weekend by the U.S.-led coalition. More than 30 suspected ISIS fighters in Iraq were killed in an air strike Saturday, on an armed convoy west of Ramadi. But officials say ISIS is moving aggressively, dispatching as many as 10,000 fighters to Anbar province from Syria and from Mosul.

Do these moves by ISIS represent a serious threat to the capital?",

So, the focus of their efforts up until now has not been so much the area <AROUND> Baghdad, although they are out there and they do occasionally make hit-and-run attacks on the defensive perimeter to the west of the city. But really, their focus is on towns like Ramadi, where yesterday the police chief was killed for the entire -- the police chief for an entire province was killed in a roadside bombing; in other towns along the Euphrates River, where they clearly want to get a foothold. But Baghdad itself, at the moment, is <WELL>-defended according to U.S. officials. There is a problem, of course, of frequent car bombs. There is a car bomb at least one every day at the capital. In <FACT>, on Saturday night there were two that killed more than 40 people. So, the concern of the Iraqi security officials itself has more to do with the threat of these car bombs presumably from ISIS within the city and not so much as these occasional probing attacks on this city's defense -- Christine."

        "statement": "Good morning from CNN headquarters in Atlanta. I'm Daryn Kagan. And let's check the headlines at this hour. National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice is seeking another private interview with the September 11 Commission. A letter from the White House counsel to the panel said that Rice would like to <CLEAR> up recent what they call, \"mischaracterizations\" of her <VIEWS> and actions prior to 9/11. The commission wants Rice to testify publicly, which the White House has refused to allow. Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat warned that the U.S. veto of a U.N. Security Counsel resolution <COULD> be a green light to Israel to carry out more assassinations. The U.S. was the sole vote yesterday against a measure condemning Monday's assassination by Israel of Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin. The U.S. says that it vetoed the resolution because it failed to condemn Hamas for terrorist attacks against Israel. Jurors in the Tyco case are back in the jury room at this hour, with the threat of a mistrial now hanging over the court. Jurors were sent home yesterday after complaining of a poisonous atmosphere in the jury room, <APPARENTLY> due to a single juror. Former Tyco executives Dennis Koslowski and Mark Schwartz are accused of plundering Tyco more than $60 million. And in Bridgeport, Connecticut demolition crews today will begin tearing down a badly burned section of Interstate 95. Intense heat from thousands of gallons of blazing fuel nearly melted the new overpass, caused by the spectacular crash of a tanker truck. The basic repairs will take at least 10 days, but it could be much long if engineering determine the entire overpass <MUST> be rebuilt. We are going to begin this hour at the White House and the election year minefield of the 9/11 investigations. The Bush administration is offering to have National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice <APPEAR> before the 9/11 Commission again. This would once again be behind closed doors, not the public appearance that some panel members and victim's families are seeking. Our White House correspondent Suzanne Malveaux joins us live. Suzanne, good morning."

And that will, you know, create favorable economic conditions overall. But once you start to dissect who's actually going to benefit over a period of time, I think it starts to break down. But Republicans have made this bet. They've made an argument. It's striking how many the differences as we've talked about over the last couple of weeks, with even the Bush tax cut in 2001 in terms of how many more people who are the top earners in the country benefit, as opposed to the middle class over time. But Republicans are going to notch a victory here and face voters with it next year. Mitch McConnell is on record now as saying that the effects of the tax cut will be immediate.

Here`s what we wanted to know - \"Britney Spears and Kevin Federline: Should they get back together?\" Take a look at this: with an overwhelming response, 80 percent said no; 20 percent said yes. Kareen, why do you think there`s such a strong feeling against them hooking back up?",
        "statement": "A.J., I`m right there with the majority of the viewers. I <THINK> it`s the last thing that Britney Spears needs to be doing is playing house again with her ex, OK? They`re still involved in this heated custody battle in court. It`s fine, it`s great that they`re chummy, chummy, but you <KNOW> what Britney, you`re on your way to a nice little comeback. The last thing you need is a distraction. So I don`t think it`s a good idea."

        "previous_statement": "Well, we certainly hope that they are doing their homework on each other and certainly on the North Korean side. Kim Jong-un has a team of people who is so focused is the Korean peninsula politics nuclear gamesmanship. Who Trump has briefing him preparing him for the summit is less clear. But they can't do any of that until they decide on where they're going to hold it. And it seems like a simple thing, but in fact, if you start to really think about the political implications in meeting places. Let's say Kim Jong-un wants to go to Washington or he ruled that out, you know, going to U.S. territory. No. Donald Trump ruled out going to Pyongyang. For similar reasons, he doesn't feel that security could be guaranteed there. You know, Kim Jong-un ruled out going to an aircraft carrier on the waters of the Korean peninsula. Donald Trump ruled out going to the demilitarized zone. So where does that leave us? It leaves us with trying to find a neutral location for this and there are several places in Asia that are being thrown around as possibility. Singapore and Malaysia as you see on the screen there, or also going Vietnam, Thailand also a neutral European capital like Stockholm, Sweden, Geneva, Switzerland. Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia was considered a frontrunner a few days ago. That apparently is becoming less likely possibly just because of the logistics of getting all of the international press into that country. But some of the other issues are here that Kim Jong-un apparently prefers to travel by train, much like his predecessors. He took that armored train, that luxury train to Beijing. Obviously that limits where he'd be able to go. And if he's going to fly somewhere will his jet have the fuel capacity to get in there or will he have to get a jet from another country. So, all of those logistics are being work out, and then denuclearization what is it mean for North Korea. Well, it means the American nuclear umbrella going away, it means American troops off the Korean peninsula. It means a peace treaty with South Korea. Whereas, denuclearization for the United States means North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons completely in exchange for relief from economic sanctions, normalization of relations. Two very different definitions of the term. Are they going to be able to come together, we don't know. We certainly don't know if they are going to be able to come together in a location because they haven't chosen yet. And until they know where they are going to do it, they can set a date. Donald Trump saying early June, but also indicating that it might not happen, Rosemary.",
        "statement": "It <COULD> very well prove to be the stumbling block because this, as you mention, Kim Jong-un likes and prefers to travel by train, and not only train, but a bulletproof train. He <FEELS> vulnerable in a plane and he feels very vulnerable outside his own country. So, this could indeed prove to be the thing that brings this whole thing to an end."

They're going to be disinfecting train stations, and really getting deep into some of the areas of the subway. And the police, the NYPD is going to be there, about a thousand officers. We just learn, they're going to be assisting the transit authority. One of the issues on the subways has been the homeless. So they need to get them off the subways. A lot of them have been spending their nights underground, in the subway cars. So they're going to use homeless outreach units to try and get them into shelters, to try and get them off the streets and to places where they can stay. This, of course, is all part of the bigger process for the city of reopening. The governor talking about the last few days, the different phases of which he's going to follow. According to the CDC, that first phase through fourth phase, the key really is a human lives and saving people's lives and making sure there aren't new infections. And he talked about that today, asking about what is the price, how much do you price, what is the price you pay for a human life. And here's what the governor said.",

We see a rise in hate crimes, as you mentioned, with Jews, Muslims and various minorities the target.

It goes all the way back to 34 years ago, the taking of the American embassy, which was clearly an illegal act sanctioned by the mullahs, only carried out by the mullahs, over 400 days of illegally holding Americans now hostages. Now, on a weekend where you would think if they had any self- discipline, the Iranians would have played meek, nice, civilized, three examples. The foreign minister says we have won the right to enrich. Remember, every single U.N. Security Council resolution said they had to quit enriching. They now interpret the agreement as we've won the right to enrich. Second, President Rouhani, the so-called moderate, although he's hand- picked by the dictatorship, says this is a great victory for Iran, as you just suggested, Cliff, the sanctions wall will collapse. The most amazing thing, in a regime which currently has an American pastor locked up for a year for preaching Christianity, in a regime which just arrested a whole group of people for having had communion, I mean, a deliberately vicious regime in many ways, you have the real dictator, Khamenei, saying over the weekend in a speech that the Israelis are rabid dogs, the Americans are our enemies. Now, why should any American trust a dictatorship that is openly telling us with contempt that they fully plan to break this agreement?",
        "statement": "All you've done here is you've repeated the problem. You've not presented any solution. There's no <DOUBT> that this regime in Iran is a regime that is not popular with the people in any way, shape or form. The question is, how do you deal with this issue? The approach of just pursuing sanctions and <ABSOLUTELY> no diplomacy has seen the Iranian nuclear program go from 164 centrifuges to 19,000 centrifuges. <CLEARLY> not a successful track record. This deal, for the first time ever since 2003, freezes the nuclear program, and part of the reason why it cannot be a repeat of what happened in North Korea is because, within the next six months, they're going to eliminate their stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium. As long as they don't have 20 percent enriched uranium, as long as they can't go back to 20 percent, they cannot build a bomb."

Now Romney still holds the lead with 33 percent support, Gingrich is backed by 23 percent of likely voters. But Romney's lead over his rival has almost halved in the last two weeks. We are just two days away from the South Carolina primary. And in a few hours from now, the candidates will have their last chance to impress voters there at a debate in Charleston, South Carolina. And CNN's political editor Paul Steinhauser is there and he joins us now. Paul, how is the race shaping up there in South Carolina?",

And that made a lot of news, because it indicated the race here in South Carolina <DEFINITELY> tightening up. Well, just in the last three hours two brand new polls of people who are likely to vote in the South Carolina Republican primary here. And one of them, take a look at this, this is by Politico. And right there are the top, there's Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. But you can see his advantage, his lead over Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker just 7 points. We're down to single digits in this brand new poll. This poll was conducted yesterday, that's Wednesday and Tuesday. So it was conducted entirely after Monday night's Republican presidential debate here in South Carolina where most pundits agreed Newt Gingrich had a very, very good night and Mitt Romney was on the defensive, especially over the taxes he pays and what the percentage is and if he would release his taxes, his income tax report. So another poll out this morning, Kristie, illustrating what's going on here also was conducted half before and after that debate. Before that debate, Romney had a 15 point advantage over Gingrich, after the debate down to 5. The polls are indicating, all of them, it's getting tighter, it's getting closer here. And <OF COURSE>, just about 12 hours from now right behind me here, this is the North Charleston Coliseum. This is where the CNN Southern Republican debate will be held. The last showdown for these five major Republican presidential candidates before Saturday's primary -- Kristie."

And as of right now Russia is very clear on its position. Syrian state media citing a joint statement for Moscow and Tehran saying quote \"we will respond strongly to any aggression on Syria. Russia and Iran will not allow America to dominate the world.\" That warning comes as the Trump administration tackles yet another potential threat, North Korea. Right now an aircraft carrier led strike group is deploying toward the Korean peninsula. A U.S. official confirms to CNN this is move is in a direct response to recent North Korean provocations. Meanwhile, as the White House tries to navigate all kinds of mine fields, the national security council, the very people who are helping to advise the president is seeing another shakeup. K.T. McFarland is leaving just days after chief strategist Steve Bannon was booted from the NSC. The impact it could have still unclear. CNN is covering this that only CNN can. We have a team of reporters and analysts standing by. From the Syrian border to Pyongyang, where we have the only American TV correspondent inside North Korea, let's begin with CNN senior international correspondent Clarissa Ward along the Turkish Syrian border. Clarissa, how are Syria and its allies now responding?",
        "statement": "Ana, we <DEFINITELY> are hearing some tough words from the regime of the president of Bashar al-Assad and also it's Russian and Iranian backers essentially saying if the U.S. pulls something like this again, there will be real consequences. Now, this was always the argument that the Obama administration had given for not intervening more forcefully or militarily inside Syria. That <PERHAPS> in doing so it <COULD> precipitate or escalate an actual clash between U.S. forces and Russian forces potentially leading to some <KIND OF> a global conflict or a World War III. That would be a worst case scenario. But at this stage, we still don't really <KNOW> exactly what Trump's policy in Syria is going to look like. We have seen some glimpses of it today hearing from U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley who said Assad is <DEFINITELY> one of our priorities in the sense that he <SHOULD> go. Hearing frankly different message from secretary state Tillerson that our priority fundamentally is the fight against ISIS. And of course the concern from some is that it's difficult to engage in that fight against ISIS without some fundamental level of cooperation with the Russians. A very complex situation in Syria. A lot of very nuanced issues to be taken into account. And these are exactly the sorts of issues that secretary of state Rex Tillerson and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov will be hashing out later this week -- Ana."

But with an approval rating in the 80s, President Obama has a lot of political capital to spend and presumably a good long time before he runs out of goodwill. That being said, he's in a precarious position right from the get-go. We're in the midst of an economic crisis that no one <SEEMS> to have a firm understanding of. And there are heated debates already about the <BEST> way to proceed when it comes to things like bailouts and spending programs and tax cuts, et cetera. Then there are the wars. Pull out of Iraq, step it up in Afghanistan sounds good, right? What if Iran comes into Iraq through one door as we're leaving through another? We haven't been attacked in seven-and-a-half years, but terrorism is still a <FACT> of life. Global warming, health insurance, pick something you like. Nevertheless, the new president's off to a good start, and this time we <APPEAR> to be in the hands of someone less inclined to shoot from the hip. But even President Obama's coolness under fire will be tested at some point, either by domestic politics or foreign affairs. So, here's the question.

They were saying, look, Saddam Hussein was just one man. Governments come and go. He was just a -- presidents come and go. So this isn't a big issue. Another person said the Iraqi insurgents will not be affected by this, because they weren't fighting for Saddam Hussein. They were fighting, they say, for Iraq, because they believe they see Iraq as being occupied, and they want to drive out the U.S.-led coalition. They say they're the occupying force here; they want to drive them out of Iraq. And that's the message that's been spoken to us this afternoon. We didn't see any signs of celebration on the streets here. That doesn't mean to say that there aren't people quietly in their houses very happy that Saddam Hussein has finally been captured. That was certainly the view of General Odierno, whose 4th Infantry Division patrols this area. He said that quietly, behind the scenes, he thought there would be some relief. But he was very realistic about the way the situation was going to play out in the next few days, weeks and months ahead. He said we'll literally have to wait and see whether or not this leads to further captures of Iraqi anti- coalition forces, whether or not it leads to an increase in attacks by the anti-coalition forces. So expectations, this side here in Iraq, as well, being played down by the coalition leadership, recognizing that Tikrit and perhaps some of the other towns in this area are special cases. Tikrit in particular, Wolf, being Saddam Hussein's former hometown, people here benefited from Saddam Hussein's regime. This town had better electricity, better buildings, better schools, better medical care, had these palaces. I'm talking to you from one of the palaces now. So perhaps that's why on the streets of Tikrit we really don't see anything akin to those celebrations in Baghdad, Wolf.",
        "statement": "The whole Tikriti clan had ruled Iraq for so many years, <OBVIOUSLY>. And, Nic Robertson, we got some incredibly informative details from the military briefing that you attended there in Tikrit from the troops on the ground who conducted this raid. They had information Saddam Hussein was there, and they found it. Very briefly, just walk through some of the highlights, how they did it. Because, as you and our viewers <KNOW>, there were so many false alarms in the past."

We've learned a lot here at the federal level: One, there needs to be better coordination between local and state government; secondly, that there needs to be a communications package that will be available to help deal with the situation that happened last time, which was total destruction of communications capabilities; third, that there needs to make <SURE> that there's a law enforcement alternative in case there's a breakdown of local law enforcement; fourthly, there needs to be a prepositioning of assets so that if a major storm were to come, we'd be able to move equipment in faster. But, most important, there needs to be a coordination and an understanding of the evacuation and relief plans. And I talked to the mayor and both governors that I met with yesterday about our seriousness in working with them to make sure that the plans are as effective as possible. The communications, obviously, this time <AROUND> are a lot better than last time around. And so the lessons are being learned. And my attitude toward the recommendations by Fran Townsend, who's a part of my administration, or the Congress, is we ought to take them all seriously. The objective is to respond to these natural disasters as well as we <POSSIBLY> can. The other issue down there for New Orleans, <OF COURSE>, is the levees. And we've got money in the supp to make sure that these levees are pre-Katrina or better prior to June 1st. I <THINK> we'll achieve that objective. There's -- additional money will be spent so that the levees are improved significantly by September of '07. The levees are important to -- the rebuilding of the levees or improving of the levees are very important to assure the people of New Orleans that if there is a storm, they're built to pre-Katrina levels, at least in the initial stage. But also it's important to convince people that it's OK to risk capital in New Orleans. The amazing thing in the area down there -- I don't <KNOW> if you all went with me, but it was -- there's -- it's a <TOTALLY> different attitude from when we were there before early on, obviously, after the storm. I mean, people are coming back. The sales tax along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi are higher today than they were a year ago this date and that's positive. But, look, there's still a lot of work to be done, a lot of reconstruction. The CDBG money -- and it's very important for the Congress to pass the CDBG money I requested so that the housing issue can get -- people can get back to rebuilding their homes. And Mississippi, the CDBG money will be coming out pretty quick. New Orleans, they still got a little work. The governor has proposed a plan that will be in front of the legislature I think this weekend. It's a very important step to getting this process moving. And so we've got a lot of work to do. But, yes, we're much more ready this time than last time and we're taking very seriously the lessons learned from Katrina."

        "previous_statement": "Happening now, secret communications. The Trump administration defends the alleged effort by Jared Kushner to set up secret backchannel links with the Russians, calling that normal and acceptable, but a former CIA director calls it off the map; and Democrats are calling for a review of the security clearance for the president's son-in-law. Broken trust. After meeting with President Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel says Europe can no longer completely rely on others; and Germany's foreign minister says President Trump's actions have put Europe's peace at risk. Is a crucial alliance on rocks? Democratic terrorism? Domestic terrorism. The FBI is investigating a violent attack on a commuter train after two men are killed trying to stop a man yelling anti-Muslim slurs at two young women. The president tweets that the victim stood up to hate and intolerance. Was this a hate crime and domestic terrorism? And catastrophic war. North Korea launches its third missile in three weeks as Defense Secretary James Mattis warns a conflict with North Korea could be catastrophic. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. President Trump honors America's fallen on this Memorial Day, laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns and visiting the graves of service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. But as the commander in chief considers boosting America's battle against terrorism, the White House is now on the defensive amid growing questions about contacts with Russia, including what sources say was an effort by the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to set up a pre-inauguration secret backchannel link to Russia. While a former CIA director finds that move appalling, homeland security secretary John Kelly says it's no big deal. Sources say the White House is preparing a war room to combat the growing number of allegations and leaks as multiple Russia investigations gather momentum. And new controversies are arising from the president's recent overseas trip. After meetings dominated by friction with President Trump over climate, trade and defense, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, says Europeans must, quote, \"take our fate into our own hands,\" while her foreign minister says President Trump's actions are putting Europe's peace at risk. I'll talk to Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego, an Iraq War veteran. He's on the Armed Services Committee. And our correspondents, specialists and guests, they're standing by with full coverage of the day's top stories. President Trump's son-in-law is the lightning rod as a new storm batters the White House. Top officials are rushing to downplay allegations that Jared Kushner wanted to establish a secret link to Russia back during the transition. Let's begin with CNN's Diane Gallagher. Diane, what are you learning?",
        "statement": "Yes, <WELL>, Wolf this <MAY> have actually been the reason that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump cut their portion of the overseas trip short. The official White House line was the couple always planned to head back home after the Vatican visit, but sources are now telling CNN that Kushner knew the story was <ABOUT> to break and didn't want to be standing with his father-in-law on a foreign trip when it did."

That includes more than 54,000 Iraqi army\u007ftroops, 40,000 Peshmerga fighters, 14,000 fighters from the Popular Mobilization Unit militias.

And there is a weather warning in effect for shipping off the coast of northeastern China due to thick sea ice. Mari Ramos has more, she joins us now from the world weather center -- Mari.",
        "statement": "Hey, Kristie. Good to see you. You <KNOW> what, sometimes -- well, you know, this time of year you'd expect to see sea ice, right, in many areas across northeastern China. The thing is that this time <AROUND> we're talking about some of the thickest in <QUITE> a long time. Let's go ahead and look at the pictures first of all, and then I'll show you which part of the world we're talking about. So this is an (inaudible) in Lazhou Bay in eastern China, just near Shandong Province. And just off the water here you can see how thick the ice actually is. Well, this is a problem, particularly for shipping because <OF COURSE> both cannot get in and out of the harbor. There are hundreds of boats that are literally stuck in that very thick ice and some of those boats can be permanently damaged because of the ice. Now one of the questions that comes up -- there you see the boats stuck in the ice -- that comes up often is also fishing. What happens with the fishing industry? Well, there's a lot of areas there for fishing that -- where they have fish farms, for example. Well, most of the farmers had actually finished their harvest already this year. Usually they finish that by the end of December. So they don't <THINK> that those areas will be affected. But, you know, you can see it there, pretty significant. Come back over to the weather map. This is a very busy area across northeastern China. We're talking in that northwestern corner of the Yellow Sea, in the Bohai Sea. And right over here you can actually see it on this visible satellite image from NASA the extent of the thick ice, in some cases over 125 kilometers. This is not the thickest that they've ever measures, or the widest that they've ever measured. They actually had more ice back in 2010. So this is the second time in two years where we have something so significant. And you guys in Beijing and Seoul, you know what I'm talking about. But it has been so cold over the last couple of weeks. And that of course has helped create that sea ice that you see there. Minus 4 now in Tokyo. The situation in Japan is going to be more snowfall on the way for you after all the snow that you had over the weekend, also very strong winds expected here as another push of cold air continues to move across the northeastern portion of the continent. This is what it looks like on the satellite as you can see here. Another area I want to talk to you about is as we head farther to the south, this is Indonesia. Over the weekend reports coming out of this area, particularly near Jakarta, of some very heavy rain. Well, this rain I don't think it's really associated to Tropical Cyclone Iggy, that storm is way down here to the south nearing the coast of Australia. However, this time of year we are talking about the wettest time of the year here across this part of world, anywhere from Papua New Guinea, which we had landslides last week, back over toward Indonesia of course, and peninsular parts of Malaysia. So <DEFINITELY> something to monitor. The other thing is, of course, is our Tropical Cyclone Iggy right here off the coast of Australia. Even though high waves have been a concern and even some scattered showers, the center of the storm itself is expected to stay out at sea and not have a direct impact here on this western coast of Australia. I want to switch gears completely and give you a brief update on what's happening in Europe, because this is also another big story, a lot going on. The heavy snowfalls across eastern Europe finally coming to an end. You look at the snow banks, Kristie, in some cases several meters high here. The snow coming to an end, but that Arctic high pressure will spread that cold air all the way into western Europe -- London, even today you were struggling to get out of freezing. Paris, you <MIGHT> not even get out of freezing over the next couple of days. Back to you."

But what we're also hearing tonight from a company that once sold this powder to the organizer of this color play party, and that organizer has told us that the boxes that are used to ship these packets of powder are clearly labeled saying that this powder can indeed become flammable. We saw the results of that in that awful video of exactly what happened here at this water park on the weekend. And now we're facing the situation where there are 200 or so people in critical condition in hospital out of about 500 who have been injured. They're suffering not only very severe burns like the 90 percent of burns to her body of that woman that did pass away, but there are also suffering damage to their respiratory systems, to their internal organs, because they've now inhaled that powder, which we know to be flammable.",

Illinois <COULD> be the next state to consider legalizing same-sex marriage. Three lawmakers have filed a measure that would eliminate the part of state law that now explicitly prohibits gay marriage. Women in the U.S. military can expect new roles placing them even closer to the combat zone. The defense department said that possibility will occur when it opens up nearly 14,000 new jobs to military women. Right now, women are restricted from serving in small ground units involved in combat. So, for the past decade, many have served in support positions that have put them in harm's way anyway. Some of the new jobs include tank or artillery mechanics, field surgeons in forward position, and crew members on missile launchers. A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by the animal rights group PETA that SeaWorld was enslaving killer whales for human amusement. The judge ruled the 13th Amendment that prohibits slavery does not apply to non-humans. The judge called slavery an involuntary servitude uniquely human activities. SeaWorld says the lawsuit was a baseless publicity stunt, but PETA says it will pursue other avenues to help SeaWorld's five killer whales. The U.N. is calling it appalling brutality. Crime so horrible, outcomes so gruesome, we can't even show you on television. Coming up next, the desperate situation in Syria growing even more dire.

And they came up with this -- they decided to bury him at his headquarters in Ramallah, which is an official building. It's not a burial place. So, they have to prepare it, and that's what we see. We see a lot of action -- right there you see it -- a lot of action cleaning up the headquarters. Also, they expect lots of crowds to show up for the burial ceremony. They expect a lot of Palestinians to pour in and <PERHAPS> spend days and nights there in shifts, just to be there. So, they have a lot of cleaning up to do, and a lot of preparation. You <KNOW>, to bury him, they have specific guidelines that they need to follow -- which way the burial place is going to be facing, and which way he's going to be buried.

I mean, I <THINK> actually on the whole, things, despite the bombing, things are more promising in Pakistan than they have been in the last six or seven months.

Iraq's prime minister, meanwhile, is dealing with his own personal hostage crisis. A 75-year-old cousin of Ayad Allawi was kidnapped last night at gunpoint, along with the man's wife and the couple's daughter-in-law. An Islamist group is threatening to behead all three unless Allawi frees Iraqi detainees and stands down in Falluja. And Mosul joins Baghdad as a city under curfew tonight after a deadly attack there today on a police convoy. Two officers and a civilian were killed, five other officers wounded."

And a lot of the subtext of his speech was aimed at younger voters, voters of color, because, as you remember, these were the constituencies that did not turn out for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and it made a critical difference in that election. Barack Obama has a connection to these voters. He's a motivating factor for these voters. And I think he's going to spend the next 12 or 11 days now speaking directly to those young people. And not just in these public appearances, but he's been a heavy presence in digital on social media in -- on channels that are -- that speak directly to these constituencies.

And what the DNI started the -- his speech with was he -- that basically he was there at the behest of President Trump. President Trump wanted him to do this. And, you know, President Trump is a master counter programmer, as we have seen for the past four years. And so every time President Obama speaks, <SHOULD> we expect -- I mean you know nothing gets his goat, nothing gets President Trump's goat like President Obama.

Dr. Craig Spencer, the Director of Global Health in the E.R. medicine at New York Presbyterian Columbia University Medical Center, Dr. Seema Yasmin, CNN medical analyst. Thank you both. Important conversation, I'm so glad you are both here. Dr. Yasmin, let's start with you. In your piece, you talked about a colleague, not a doctor, but someone who works in the E.R. who said that there is a cure for COVID-19. There is not. And even though he was shown evidence proving there was no cure, he said but I saw it on Facebook. I mean, -- come on, how deep is this information go? That's like my every conversation I have with someone I know who is a Trump supporter, I'm like oh, my gosh, but go on.",

And you <THINK>, come on, you <SHOULD> <KNOW> better but it really hits home this point, Don. That everyone at some level is susceptible to this health misinformation and disinformation because there's so much nonsense that is circling out there. The people who are pushing it are really praying on the <FACT> that we are already vulnerable right now, we're scared, we're anxious, we're overwhelmed with information. We don't know what to <BELIEVE>. The president saying one thing, the scientists are saying another. So, then you have platforms like Facebook and other social media platforms really spreading the stop and using algorithms that reward engagement with the bad information. Because the <STUFF> that is crappy, the nonsense is usually a lot more fantastical, a lot more memorable. You want to share it, compared to the <KIND OF> boring, dry <FACTS> that the medical institutions are putting out there. So, this report that came out last week from the organization Avaaz looks at how much misinformation and disinformation is spreading on Facebook. They found in the last year, their stuff got 3.8 billion <VIEWS>. It's not just being crank that cannot keep up, CDC and WHO can't either, they are putting stuff out there on Facebook too. The good information, it's getting nowhere near as many hits and as many views, so it's a really tough situation."

Since losing the 2000 presidential race, Gore has spent much of his time traveling the world and lecturing about what he calls a planetary emergency. The columnist Richard Cohen writes that, although this film is about the most boring of topics, it will ultimately captivate, rivet and scare you because of where planet Earth is headed. Cohen writes, \"It may be that Gore will do more good for his country and the world with this movie than Bush ever did by beating him in 2000.\" Here's the question: Should politicians like Al Gore be making movies?

They say three boats from Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps came to the ship, tried to got in the ship's way and tried to force the ship into Iranian waters. Now, the Brits say that their warship got between the speed boats and tanker and even pointed the guns at the Iranian speed boats and gave them a verbal warning and that's when those speedboats then turned away. Now, <OF COURSE>, we <KNOW> all this coming in extremely tense situation with the Brits having seized an Iranian tanker just a couple of days ago, Iran's leadership saying there would be retaliation, but the Iranians saying this incident was not them. They say they didn't try to seize a tanker. I just got some new information from you now from the Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. They claim, this is a statement they just put out a couple of minutes ago, they claimed: During the past 24 hours, there have been no encounters with foreign vessels, including the British one. So, all of that, of course, contributes to that additional uncertainty there in that key region.

It's quite likely his support in eastern Iowa will remain very high.

He has not been savaged on talk radio in Des Moines the way he was consistently four years ago. I think the big question will be western Iowa, whether he can get his fair share of western Iowa conservatives. To me, that's one of big unknowns of the campaign. I think he's in very good shape.

And those smugglers frequently are involved as well in political terrorism, and indeed, they use the receipts from smuggling to finance terrorism. And we don't want to create that and we're worried.

So I think that a lot of the response was just the chance for Chicago and the democrats here, there is a democratic primary going on to just say no, we don't want Donald Trump. So in a sense it was a preview of what <COULD> be a general election contest. I mean, if Donald Trump <THINKS> that he can make Illinois competitive, if he thinks he can make Michigan competitive <SHOULD> he become the nominee this is what we could see. But I was struck just the earnestness of the protest. We talked to one demonstrator, one man who lived in the neighborhood where this rally was supposed to be going on. And this is why he said he came out to protest."

Rescuers are now <HOPING> to reach at least one person who <MAY> <POSSIBLY> still be alive. The quake has killed at least 250 people across central Mexico. Officials say the island of Dominica has gone into survival mode after being hit by hurricane Maria. People are in desperate need of food, water and medical supplies. Even the Prime Minister's homeless. At least 15 people on the island are known to have died in the storm. President Trump has announced new sanctions against North Korea targeting firms and individuals who trade with the country.

The Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, took a dig at the United States during the United Nations on Thursday. Saying there is no country on the planet that can walkway from the challenge and reality of climate change. Remember, President Trump announced in July he's pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Kenya says it's moving the new presidential election to October the 26th. The country's Supreme Court annulled last month's election. President Uhuru Kenyatta says that amounted to a coup. His opponent, Raila Odinga called it fraudulent. Wall Street's winning streak has come to an end. The Dow briefly had an intraday high and then it fell back -- very briefly. Look at it. Right at the beginning of the day. A smidgeon of green on the top left of your screen. Things turned thereafter. It was off 53 points, ending nine straight days of gains and seven days of record closures. The S&P and Nasdaq both closed slightly lower, as well. Let's put this into context. The Dow is still up 30 percent for the year and is closed at a record of 42 times since the beginning of the year. The IMF's managing director says she's worried about complacency as markets hit record after record and economies enjoy steady growth. Christine Lagarde is warning there's a whole generation that is yet to experience a serious market correction. Speaking to me, she urged governments to make structural changes now and ensure a rising economic tide lifts all countries."

We're going to continue to look at what sent shivers through traders across the globe. Richard Quest will join me here in the studio. But first, let's head to New York and join Felicia Taylor, who's making sense of today for us -- Felicia, go for it.",
        "statement": "Oh, I'm not <SURE> I can make sense out of it. But, you <KNOW>, where this really began was in Europe. And that was the biggest problem, because there was a report out this morning, earlier today, <OBVIOUSLY>, that said that the European banks <MAY> not be able to fund their U.S. obligation. And that sent shivers pretty much through the financial sector all across the board. European banking shares sinking. American banking shares doing the same thing. You've got Citigroup down today, I <THINK> it we are about 6 percent. You've got Wells Fargo off 4.5 percent, JPMorgan Chase down 3.75 percent. And then it just continued. There was a report from Morgan Stanley describing the <FACT> that we are at the brink of a global recession. And that again sent shivers through the marketplace, because what this has done is turned speculation. You know, Max, we've been talking about this possibility pretty much the last couple of months. But now it's turning into a reality. And that's the problem. The other <SORT OF> rumor that I heard very earlier on in today's session from one of the hedge fund guys that I talk to all the time was that a regional bank stepped up to the ECB and asked for a $500 million loan. The reason that's important is because in banking terms, that's not a tremendous amount of money. And if that's what they need to keep solvent, that's of great concern to the marketplace, because who's next, <POSSIBLY>? And then in the United States, we got a rash of economic information all pointing to the down side, whether it was an increase in jobless claims, a regional report on manufacturing that was horrendous, frankly, and also consumer inflation kicking up ever so slightly and existing home sales down 3.5 percent. You've got all sectors there pointing to the down side. And that's what put fear into the marketplace. But what's interesting is people did step in at the end of the day and sort of -- that's what they call bottom fishing, looking for good prices for stocks. So that's actually a good sign that there are buyers out there in the marketplace. There's plenty of cash on the sidelines. But we had some bad news, also, at the bread -- at the end of the day, at the -- at the close, coming from Hewlett-Packard, now saying that they're not going to be selling PCs. They've -- they're not going to be selling their touch pad anymore. They cut their sales <VIEW> and that stock was down about 7 percent right at the -- at the word of that news. But again, you know, all that glitters is gold. People have stepped into the marketplace and picked up gold once again. It's up $34 right now, at $1,828. The guys I talked to were looking for $2,000 in the near term, which, frankly, is <QUITE> amazing. Also, one other bit of news that was a little frightening in the marketplace is that a Swedish financial regulator stepped in to scrutinize the U.S. operations of -- of the European's largest lenders and said it won't take much for inter-bank lending to freeze. That is <CERTAINLY> not anything that any of us want to hear in the near-term. So, Max, it was a very volatile day. It will <PROBABLY> continue into the weekend, as people may not want to hold onto their positions in Friday's trading."

He said that that is really breaking apart in New Jersey's middle class. You look at the Conservative Heritage Foundation, and they say the majority of jobs lost over the past 30 years have been union jobs. But one last point, a labor economist I talked to this morning says this goes beyond the money, Kyra. This goes to worker satisfaction, safety in the workplace and it's not just about the money. When you have satisfied workers, that leads to better part of productivity. So two sides of this argument but day by day, it gets even more contentious. Kyra."

Again, please stay safe. If that wasn't enough now, I want to get you some more information about just how big these fissures are, how close they are to home, the kind of danger they pose. Meteorologist Tom Sater is joining us from CNN headquarters in Atlanta for more on that. Tom, help us out.",
        "statement": "All right. Let's break it all down, Ana, because it's <QUITE> massive really in its scope here. This is the main chamber. OK. Kilauea, we've seen <OF COURSE> the plumes. The fissures that are opening up are releasing this energy from underground are good 20, 25 miles away., So the lava that was in the main chamber has been draining. It's been making its way underground for that 20 or 25 miles. So let's break this down, too. Each time we have one or what's leading up to these are the tremors. We've had hundreds of them. Many <AROUND> the summit and then on the east rift. And this is where the fissures have been opening up. Now we <THOUGHT> we had number 18 today. Hawaii Volcano Observatory said no, it's just 17. Because officially to have a fissure it needs to emit lava. So you can have the smoke, you can have the pressure and the gas. But it needs to emit lava. This is Leilani Estate. These are where the homes are. Notice we've got evacuation zones, we've got road closures. The green triangles are all the fissures. Now over the weekend and last week, there was no rhyme or reason to them. We've had a couple on Thursday that were to the southwest and a couple of more to the northeast. But these weekends have been the furthest to the east that we have seen which tells you that this is traveling underground until it gives. So as this lava is released, it is draining the main chamber. That's important to <KNOW> here. Take a look at this imagery that we've got from the USGS. It's a camera that looks down into the caldera. As the lava drops, which was at the top, it releases pressure so there's like landslides. There's debris that falling inside. Here is the lava on April 23rd. Now this is important because there is a fear that we <COULD> have a steam driven, massive, violent eruption if this lava drops all the way down to the water table which is at 1500 feet. Right now the lava is down almost 1200. A couple of feet a day. Another near little 3D imagery, technology is amazing here. From the USGS. they can tell us from using their high-tech cameras what this caldera or this chamber is actually shaped like. And it's getting down and tapering at the end which means debris is coming down which is going to cause pressure but it's also like packing a cannon. And when this thing goes, it's going to blow. Let's take a look another 3D area and you'll get an idea of exactly what we've been watching. So as the fissures again release the magma, we'll see the magma in the main chamber drop. If it gets down to this water level here, with all that debris inside, it doesn't mean it's going to happen but the elements are there. And if they interact just perfectly, this is where a massive eruption could occur like it did in 1924 where you had boulders that were eight tons, you know, size of a car, to 14 tons. Ana, that's like a semi tractor trailer truck that were blown a good half mile to even a mile away. So it's dropping quickly. It's a big concern. The more fissures that are expected, which will most likely happen, will drain more of that lava from the main caldera or that main chamber. So it's a little frightening but the tremors are going to continue to occur as this activity continues."

We're told right now Iraq's political leadership are meeting to try and figure out what to do. This follows meetings with U.S. and British officials among the Kurds and the Shia earlier today. Now, all along, Carol, there had been two major issues crippling this process, the role of religion and the notion of federalism. On the former, we're told an agreement has been reached in principle. The head of Iraq's National Assembly telling me earlier that Islam will be \"a main source of Iraqi legislation.\" That will raise concerns among women's rights groups, who had hoped Islam would simply \"a\" source, one of many, something they felt was necessary to ensure their rights. It will also raise questions about role, how prominent a role religious clerics will play in the new Iraq. But that other issue, federalism, is emerging as an impasse. The Kurds want explicit reference to it in the constitution, maintaining an autonomous region in the north. The Sunnis want all talk of federalism sidelined until a new government comes into power. And the Shia are perhaps split. Some of them are calling for an autonomous region in the country's south. Others are calling for a unified, single Iraq. So that is what they are working to try and find compromise on, Carol. They have now just about 10 hours to try and do that -- Carol.",

Again, although there saying they know these two are members of the Russian military intelligence agency, they are not saying that they have confirmed their actual identities. That is their names, where there from, who they actually are, because that today the police have only revealed the aliases that they believe they were traveling under. But I guess what it does mean is that if they do set foot in Europe and they are identified it does open the possibility for them to be arrested and sent back here. So, potentially if these guys are professional spies who move around to carry out operations, it does limit what they can do and how they could actually move and operate within Europe itself -- Lynda.",

Now, keeping him honest, the <FACT> is that during the regular season last year, not one Eagle took a knee during the anthem. One player did in the preseason but was cut before the regular season began. Some players did raise a fist. The president later sent a tweet implying that members of the Super Bowl-winning Eagles stayed in the locker room during the anthem: Staying in the locker room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country's kneeling. Sorry. Well, keeping them honest, that's also not true. They didn't stay in the locker room, when it became abundantly <CLEAR> that the event had been canceled more for lack of the Eagles than anything else, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders then tried a little gaslighting, saying, quote: The vast majority of the Eagles team decided to abandon their fans. Now, it's hard to find a team more loyal to its fans and vice versa in good times and bad, notwithstanding insinuation from the White House the ties run deep then late today yet another line came from the White House."

It looks like, in all of those districts, that Democrats will be No. 2 in all of them. There are two that are still somewhat of a question. Number -- District 10, Jeff Denham, the Republican, will face either Josh Harder or Ted Howze. And in the 48th, there are two Democrats and a Republican vying for that No. 2 spot. All of this could take some time to figure out, because in one case, 188,000 were left off the voter rolls in Los Angeles County, so they had to fill out paper ballots. Those had to be counted. And mail-in ballots. People could walk up on election day and even mail them in on election day. Those will take time to count. So we may see this -- a couple of these races that may be days, if not weeks, before we know the final answer. Back to you guys.",

Now he's <SORT OF> -- he's making calls on where the market <MAY> go. I thought that was <QUITE> interesting. But the third point is the currency. That's also caused a huge amount of concern worldwide. There was a devaluation of the Chinese Yuan after the authorities let it be more focused on market forces. The Yuan has fallen. He is now saying that it is at a fair value, about 3% lower than it was, that's also key. Now whether it stays that way remains to be seen. He's talking about market forces, reforms.

That is in addition to four people already in custody. Let's go live to the capital of Malaysia right now, Kuala Lumpur. CNN Saimah Mohsin is there.

Now it's because of that the South Korean unification ministry, it is am ministry that deals with North Korea and Seoul say they have no <DOUBT> any more that Pyongyang is behind this now murder investigation. And you'll remember that it was as early as the next day after he was killed that South Korea intelligence officials said they <BELIEVE> North Korea was behind this, because they have made several previous attacks on his life, Pamela."

I spoke myself to the now famous Edith Pfeffer, the chairwoman of the Clinton County Republicans, spoke with her. She said, hey, we turned in those results not long after 7:00, sometime <AROUND> 7:40, 7:50. The problem, guys, seems to be that there were some tabulating issues here in Des Moines with the state headquarters. I <GUESS> they didn't realize that they didn't have those numbers. And this <MIGHT> happen a lot in elections. Usually it all gets squared away the next day. But, <OF COURSE>, here we were with an election resting on just a handful of votes. So every single precinct mattered. And when they discovered they were missing a couple, we had to wait and track down each one. Also, and then you can see and you're hearing video from, of course, all of the various candidate parties. Zoraida and Ashleigh, it was so interesting because here were these ballrooms full of supporters all night waiting to see their candidates, and the candidates really weren't <SURE> what to say for a while, especially Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney.

The Saudi foreign minister wants to talk to the president about the situation in Iraq, and it comes, as Ari Fleischer says, at a critical juncture in the region. One of the things the Saudis have been working on is a plan to try to get Saddam Hussein out of Iraq, to try to find a place for him to go into exile. The White House hasn't been very hopeful that this is a prospect that's really got any <KIND OF> a life to it, but Ari Fleischer did say today -- quote -- \"Suffice to say, if Saddam Hussein were to go into exile, that would be a very helpful event for the world.\" But he also noted that they are making plans, other plans -- and we <KNOW> what those plans are -- in the event he doesn't go into exile. Other meetings today, as you mentioned, a key meeting with the prime minister of Italy, that's Silvio Berlusconi. He was one of the signators to the letter signed by eight European leaders, signaling that they are in solidarity with the United States in dealing with Saddam Hussein. Tomorrow, he has another important meeting. He will meet with the British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has been really the U.S.'s number one ally in dealing with Iraq -- Fred."

In the days when I first came to Washington, if we had been running a $160 billion surplus when the economy had a 0 percent growth rate, the so-called Keynesians would have been saying, \"You're out of your mind.\" You ought to have at least a $200 billion tax cut because, instead of taking money away from the American people when the economy is running slow, we ought to give them back more money than they sent in. You know, so it's really quite paradoxical that people are wringing their hands when we're running $160 billion surplus, that they don't think it's enough. I think it's really quite good that we're able to run $160 billion surplus when we have effectively zero growth in the economy or something close to that.

And so the <FACT> that the Trump campaign was unable to fill this 20,000 capacity arena isn't the TikTokers' fault. But what was playing out all week on TikTok and some other social media platforms, too, was this massive push for people to register for the event and then not show up. And that I think, <PROBABLY>, did <DEFINITELY> contribute to the inflation figures of the expectation of folks who are going to attend the rally. And I want to show you how this played out on TikTok, what it looked like. Take a look at this TikTok video from Toren Hudson (PH), the 16- year-old who took part on the online protest."

Now, this report is not legally binding. But some of the information they came up with is interesting. They were given significant logs in terms of the flights and exactly where they happened. There were more than 1,200 of these flights, in <FACT>. Germany had 336. The United Kingdom, 170; Portugal, 91; Spain, 68; Italy, 46; Ireland, 147. I mean, these were a lot of flights, mainly conducted in 2003 and 2004. What is interesting here is that the European Union has called on these individual governments to launch their own investigations, mainly because they don't have the power to investigate further. It <SEEMS> highly <UNLIKELY> that any of these countries will do so. They will take cover under national security, saying that they won't be allowed to divulge this. There has been speculation that, in fact, a secret CIA prison was operating in both Poland and Romania. President Bush, back in September, admitted that these CIA prisons did exist. And, although they don't have any detainees in them right now, he wouldn't rule out the fact they would be used again in the future. This has really been an issue nagging at the European parliament. I <THINK> they don't want to have the taint of these kinds of secret clandestine transfers, interrogations, hanging over Europe. And so they have pushed this issue through to the parliament. As I said, there is <ABSOLUTELY> nothing that is legally binding about this. This issue, though, will continue to grind on in the European parliament. They expect to go through this report. As I said, it's only a draft report. They expect to go through it early in the new year. Paula Newton, CNN, London."

What that, <OF COURSE>, makes investigators concerned about is the possibility that there's another cell that's just as good.

But are they more of a liability at this point than an asset? Here's the deal. With the insurgency roiling Iraq, the Bush administration is quick to blame Iran and Syria for destabilizing Iraq's young government. But today comes the word that nearly half the foreign fighters now terrorizing Iraq are actually from Saudi Arabia. Yes, that Saudi Arabia. The U.S. ally where 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers came from. The other country that's problematic, Pakistan. That country's president, Pervez Musharraf, <MAY> be indirectly helping Al Qaeda get its act together. Staying in Pakistan, and what is a major turn of events, Islamic fighters in a lawless region that borders Afghanistan have ended a truce with the government. Now, remember, Musharraf promised that he would be able to keep Al Qaeda in check, under control. But attacks in this region this weekend have killed at least 70 people, including Pakistani troops, as <WELL> as police officers. This truce has been the subject of a painful second-<GUESSING> game. U.S. officials are complaining that Musharraf's hands-off stance has made the region, Pakistan, an even bigger base now for Al Qaeda.

So in effect they're going along with a tax hike.",
        "statement": "No, <ABSOLUTELY> not. They -- the Republicans in the House and the Senate have made it very <CLEAR> they wanted to extend those tax cuts permanently for everybody. They voted that way in 2001, 2003, again several times this last year. The Republicans are on record, all of them, that all of these tax cuts <SHOULD> be extended -- this is Obama's pound of flesh because he won the presidential election. He's the one insisting that taxes go up. They're going to take $500 billion out of savings in the United States over the next decade and give it to the federal government. This is not helpful to the economy, and it will hurt the economy. But remember Obama is not just raising taxes on the rich right now. We're about to enter a decade where a trillion-dollars is going to be taken away from the American people in higher taxes to pay for Obamacare. This was passed only by Democrats. It is entirely a Democrat tax increase. And it includes many taxes that directly hit middle income and lower income people. So Obama's tax increase is not just the top tax rates. It's people -- if you have bad health problems and you spend more than 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income on out-of- pocket health costs, you used to be able to deduct anything above that. Thanks to Obama's law, Obamacare, that's now 10 percent. So $2 million to $3 million will be taken out of people average income $53,000 a year, who are lower income, middle income and sick. They're going to be paying taxes for Obamacare. There's an avalanche of Obama tax increases coming next year."

She's just down the road from where I am, Alisyn, at Windsor Castle, in a safe space. Prince Charles in a safe space up in Scotland. But what we're more concerned about whether was this meeting earlier in the month. Was he contagious? Did she catch it? Have other members of the family caught it as well?

You remember that up until about eight days ago there was a very hard case to make against Trump which was that you had to prove that he was <ABSOLUTELY> colluding with Russian and interfering with our election. And that he had something illegal in the course of doing that. I <THINK> that would have been very difficult to prove even though there was evidence that that some of the low-level people in the Trump campaign were in contact with Russians. It wouldn't hard to prove that Donald Trump himself was in- charge of all that. But now, in trying to stop that investigation, Donald Trump has created a world of trouble for himself, a world of hurt because he fired James Comey and now we are seeing all of the evidence that Comey is going to bring forward in his memos of obstruction of justice."

There are examples where he questioned that. particularly, towards the end of his life but by all accounts, he believed there was -- he knew Stalin, he could work with Stalin. He stopped getting advice from the advisers and people with deep expertise on Russia and you could argue he was too close to it. I <THINK> some of this had to do with the <FACT> that, you know, I don't think Roosevelt was in denial about his health. I think Roosevelt knew he was dying but he wanted to beat the clock, finish the war, <MAYBE> become the first secretary general of the U.N. but finish the job while he was still on earth. What impresses me about Truman is the fact that unlike, you know, LBJ, who buys into the argument that Ho Chi Minh is somebody we can maybe get a better compromise with by over eagerly negotiating and so forth. Truman doesn't buy any of that with Stalin on day one. And he has no institutional knowledge which would lead him to this conclusion. It's pure instinct. And he's getting all sorts of advice from people pushing a Roosevelt agenda, people pushing their own agendas. And for somebody who's following the great FDR to be able to assert themselves so early on without neglecting the legacy of FDR during such an important moment in history, it's nothing short of extraordinary."

Children learn from these social experiences. Of course, the mother is important, but few people in this country believe that only the mother is important. We've had a long history of children going to nursery school. Very, very few children actually have experiences only with the mother.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the head Republican in the Senate, says it is -- quote -- \"highly likely\" the Senate Intelligence Committee will look at Flynn's communications with the Russian ambassador. Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, who is on the Intelligence Committee and is a member of the Senate Republican leadership as well, also called for an investigation into connections between President Trump and Russia. He also says Flynn needs to talk. CNN's Phil Mattingly joins me now from Capitol Hill. Phil, can we expect House Republicans to continue to carry the water for the White House on this matter and leave the oversight responsibility of the legislative branch entirely up to the Senate?",

Now, the House Intelligence Committee also has an investigation into Russian meddling into the election going on. But member after member on the Republican side of things seemed to defend Mike Flynn or instead go after the idea that leaks need to be investigated. Not so in the Senate, though, Jake. Just a couple of minutes ago in this hallway down behind me, the Senate Intelligence Committee just broke up from a classified meeting where they discussed this issue specifically. And why does this matter? This is the investigation that, by all accounts, if there is going to be one that has teeth, it will be this one. And if you want to <KNOW> why, Vice Chairman Mark Warner, Virginia senator of this bipartisan committee, told me this morning he wants Mike Flynn to testify in front of this panel. Take a listen."

When you see a lot of lightning you <KNOW> we're talking about the severe thunderstorm cells developing. In <FACT>, for that reason, you can actually see the severe thunderstorm warnings. As one of these expires, another one shows up. Notice here look in the distance as one cell builds right behind the other. That's what we're starting to see this morning. So it looks like it's not letting up just yet. Currently these warning boxes not expire for at least another hour. What happens when you have a severe thunderstorm warning? Well, we're talking about strong winds. So keep in mind all the debris that's out there this morning, all of that is going to be blowing <AROUND>. Hail, they reported pebble-size hail. But <CERTAINLY> in a system like this, we're going to be talking about golf ball size hail and some of those strong winds. We <COULD> see gusts really <KIND OF> picking up. Now a lot of these systems 20 to 30 miles per hour unless, <OF COURSE>, don't forget the heavy rain with that. Of course, a lot of people don't have shelter this morning so a very tough situation for them. Not the only thing we're looking at. You can really tell the heavy amounts of rain out there. One of the things that I like to mention, people really underestimate the power of flooding. A lot of flooding could occur, six inches of water. That's all it takes to take a human life. Try and cross that flood water, that's all it takes. Two feet of water even a large SUV can be swept away. Number one reason for deaths in this country when it comes to weather is the flooding. When we see cells like this, we're very concerned. I want to show you also it not the only risk area today. Original low, the one that produced all of that mess over in the plains, that same low has made its way to the northeast. We do have a slight risk area for us as well. We're going to talk about strong winds, hail, and the heavy rain for us, isolated tornadoes. Not really the major threat here in the northeast, but once we go right back in towards Oklahoma and panhandle of Texas, not in the forecast. Not as high of a risk as what we saw a few days ago but still, like we're already seeing, the large hail, strong winds and heavy rain, in the forecast and here the threat is higher than in the northeast for certainly <POTENTIAL> here for an isolated tornado. Unfortunately, this forecast from mere is not just for today. As we go through Memorial Day weekend, showers will remain in the forecast. So hard, everyone is trying to get their lives together."

The judge in this case, Lloyd Nash has said that he intends to appoint an independent counsel to come in and speak to Caldwell. The person that he specifically plans to appoint is Steve Sitcoff (ph) , a defense attorney here in town who has represented Aaron Sorkin (ph) in the past, in drug-related charges. Earl Caldwell objected to that, so the exact person who will be chosen remains to be seen. The prosecution had also hoped in a separate motion to remove William Jordan, a private investigator who is assisting the defense team. He had helped Mr. Blake there the past on the custody issue involving Bonny Lee Bakley. The judge has denied that motion of the prosecution, so Jordan will stay on with the team. Joining me how is Harland Braun, the defense attorney for Robert Blake during the hearing today we heard the judge chastised you for the language you used in your moving papers, among the things you did is you called Steve Coolly, the district attorney, a semi-competent district attorney and things like that. He said he wasn't going to tolerate mud slinging in his courtroom. You didn't really get a chance to speak to that."

        "statement": "Wolf, the moving parts never stop moving in this story. I've been in contact with his attorney, Donald Sterling's attorney, Maxwell Blecher, this afternoon via e-mail. Blecher said he is not denying a new report that the Clippers owner is suing the NBA for damages in excess of $1 billion. His office tells us they <MAY> have something posted on their website shortly. Now, does all of this mean he's contesting the sale of the Clippers? <MAYBE>. Maybe not. Earlier today Maxwell Blecher had told us Sterling would look at the sale of the Clippers to Steve Ballmer and decide where to go from there, saying, quote, \"He doesn't want to fight with Shelly. That's the bottom line.\" That's a quote from Max Blecher to me on the phone earlier today. I don't <KNOW> what the lawsuit means versus what he said to me about contesting the sale, Wolf. Another key piece of news we have today. Sources telling us the doctors have determined Donald Sterling to be mentally incapacitated. This was a finding by two independent doctors, neurologists, presumably, we <BELIEVE>, earlier this month in two different examinations. And we have learned from one source that there is a clause in the trust between Donald and Shelly Sterling that says if one of them were to become mentally unfit, then the other would be the sole trustee. And that presumably opened the door for her to negotiate that sale with Steve Ballmer. Again, I tried to get reaction. I did get reaction from Maxwell Blecher to that finding. He said that's a vast overstatement of mental incapacitation. That this was a diagnosis really of, quote, \"modest mental impairment.\" And that maybe something akin to just slowing down mentally. And he is basically saying that mental incapacitation is not the case. At least not that degree of it."

John Walker Lindh is charged with four criminal counts, including conspiracy to kill Americans. Walker Lindh told a magistrate judge he understood the charges and that he <COULD> be sentenced to life in prison if convicted. Attorney General John Ashcroft says the United States could seek additional charges that carry the death penalty. In Afghanistan, U.S. Army special forces attacked two Taliban compounds today, killing about 12 fighters and taking 27 prisoners. The Pentagon says an American soldier was wounded, but his injury is not life-threatening. The fighting happened some 35 miles north of Kandahar. And here in Washington, supporters of campaign finance reform say they have collected 218 signatures, enough to force a vote on the issue on the House floor. No date has been set for debate and vote on the bill, which would virtually ban what's called soft money. Those are the unlimited sums that go to politicians. Campaign finance reform passed the Senate last year, but stalled in the House of Representatives. Widespread campaign donations by Enron helped fuel the move toward finance campaign reform in the House. And today, Capitol Hill began focusing on Enron's dramatic collapse. How did it happen and who knew what and when? Today, both the House and Senate opened hearings into the matter. From Capitol Hill, our congressional Kate Snow, she joins us now with more on who is talking and who is not talking -- Kate."

Police race to a million-dollar mansion to find a little girl at her bedroom computer doing homework, dead, her little brother still buckled in the minivan, dead. Then they find Mommy out lounging by the luxury pool in the back yard, who calmly explains she guns down her two children, shooting them in the mouth, because they talked back. In the last hours, we hear from Mommy herself, Mommy`s journal, in which she details her innermost thoughts and feelings about how she`s going to shoot her children dead. Let`s take a look at what Mommy said in her own writing. This is what I observed in court. Mommy now has her hair pulled back, mousey brown, in a bun. She won`t look at any of the witnesses. She won`t turn around and look at her husband, Colonel Parker Schenecker. She sits there acting like she`s taking notes, as if nothing`s going on around her. But let`s take a look into Mommy`s life. Let`s see the screens, Liz - - what we learned that Mommy writes in her journal. I did all my duties. Then I went to buy a gun. I was planning a Saturday massacre, but had to wait for a background investigation for three days. Let`s keep it going. Calyx called me pathetic. On Saturday, she called me an evil soul. The evil starts Thursday. Calyx, you know what? She gets it first. Don`t know whether I`ll turn on the light (to blind) or just react to have me in her bedroom. I`m nervous. Next -- I offed Beau on the way to practice. I offed Beau on the way to practice. He saw the gun and told me to put it back in the purse. He had a healthy fight, then when we got home, a shot to his mouth (because) he became so mouthy, just like Calyx. Calyx drove me to drink. He (Beau) was yelling at me. The first shot hit the windshield. Second shot was the side of his head. Next shot to the mouth, his mouthy mouth. Came home. Calyx is on the upstairs computer. Asked, What are you doing? Just (seeing) what you are doing, walked up without her reacting and shot her in the right temple. Then shot her in the mouth (her sassy little mouth). Really tore my soul to the core. Shot the two mouthy mouths in the mouth after shooting them in the head. I`m just losing my mind. I`d like to die by Beau in our bed. That would be nice. Beau and I are going to heaven. Wish heaven for Calyx, too. \"Wish.\" Whoa! Lucky you weren`t there -- talking to her husband. Probably would have offed you, too. Would have been a crying shame. I sensed divorce was inevitable, but I can`t live alone.\" All right, straight out to Roger Schulman, Tampa radio reporter in court today, Roger with me in the courtroom all day yesterday. Roger, as I watched Colonel Parker Schenecker in the courtroom, I could tell he was about to burst into tears. Today, he was on the stand. What did you observe?",

The problem here is that this explosive detector years ago was found to be fake. The manufacture was sentenced to 10 years in prison in the United Kingdom for fraud. He sold this detector to several countries <AROUND> the world. This is been pulled off the market. And British police at that time described is a fancy golf ball detector that's still being used in Baghdad, and up until that attack happened.

And as you mentioned earlier, their advanced security team on Tuesday when they're carrying out that reconnaissance mission to try and inspect the site ahead of the arrival of the OPCW fact-finding mission, they came under fire one of these locations and also an explosive device was detonated. But as we understand no one was hurt. We need to keep in mind what the scope of the mission of this OPCW fact-finding mission is going to be. It's not to assign blame.

They're sitting down to discuss what previously-held joint talks might have done, in terms of bringing them closer to declaring a cease-fire. Now, those joint talks -- it was a meeting planned for this evening. It was, however, postponed -- have been shared by the U.S. special envoy, Anthony Zinni. They're designed to try to hammer out difference between the two, and settle on what one side wants the other side to do in order for a cease-fire to take place. While those talks have been continuing, however, a familiar parallel: more violence. In the Rafah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers entering to look for tunnels they say are used for weapons smuggling. A 19-year-old Palestinian shot dead in exchanges of fire there. Also killed and mourned, 23-year-old Massad Abu-Asi (ph). He was shot dead by Israeli soldiers who said he ignored their warnings to stop at a crossing in Gaza. Also buried today, an Israeli man who was killed in an ambush as he drove his car in Hebron. There were other clashes around the occupied territories as well. In this incident, Israeli rubber bullets and tear gas injuring five Palestinians. An Israeli solder was also hurt. Meanwhile, debate continues over whether the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, will be permitted by Israel to travel to Beirut, and the Arab Summit, which gets under way there on Wednesday. CNN has been told that senior Israeli politicians will sit down tomorrow, Tuesday, and come to some sort of decision on that, we're told. So, Yasser Arafat may know in the next 24 hours or so whether he will or will not be going to Beirut. Back to you.",

Look, as I said before, I think, to me and to many, what's most extraordinary about these e-mails is how ordinary the idea that the Russian government is trying help Donald Trump seems to Donald Trump Jr. It doesn't bat an eyebrow at that suggestion and rather, immediately, is thinking about how to leverage it for the biggest political advantage. I think the other question that Senator Warner left out is not only how high this goes, but how broadly, how wide this goes. Because, this, while coming clearly under the umbrella of a Russian effort to help the candidate, Trump, is around a fairly narrow set of questions. It does not, at least on the last information we have so far, which is probably not the last war we're going to have in this meeting. At least on the information we have so far does not yet implicate the question of either the hacking of the DNC and John Podesta's e-mail and or which I think is also an important area of investigation that the role of Russian agencies in spreading fake news and you know, misleading news stories targeted into key states in the U.S. election. And whether they had any help in deciding where from Moscow to target those efforts. I mean, those are, in many ways, the broader questions that most of the public is still focused on. This meeting at this point does not yet address that. But one thing I feel pretty confident about is that, as these stories have shifted, it's just under the glare of the news media. Once people start testifying under oath and documents are subpoenaed, it is likely our understanding of what happened in that initial meeting is going to be different at the end than it is today.",

Even if this Russian lawyer had no information, some have suggested it <COULD>'ve been a typical Kremlin play to see if the Trump campaign was at least open to the idea of working with the Russian government. In a very broad sense, does that ring true?"

And it`s not the porn that hurts the kids. It`s not the bombs that hurt the kids. It`s just their upbringing. Well, their upbringing is crappy, but they`re also getting a lot of crappy inputs.

But also, with hurricane season only a month away, can you assure the American people that your government has learned the lessons of Katrina?",
        "statement": "Thanks for the question. That was on <OBVIOUSLY> on people's minds when I went down to New Orleans and Mississippi. The lessons of Katrina are very important. We've learned a lot here at the federal level: One, there needs to be better coordination between local and state government; secondly, that there needs to be a communications package that will be available to help deal with the situation that happened last time, which was total destruction of communications capabilities; third, that there needs to make <SURE> that there's a law enforcement alternative in case there's a breakdown of local law enforcement; fourthly, there needs to be a prepositioning of assets so that if a major storm were to come, we'd be able to move equipment in faster. But, most important, there needs to be a coordination and an understanding of the evacuation and relief plans. And I talked to the mayor and both governors that I met with yesterday about our seriousness in working with them to make sure that the plans are as effective as possible. The communications, obviously, this time <AROUND> are a lot better than last time around. And so the lessons are being learned. And my attitude toward the recommendations by Fran Townsend, who's a part of my administration, or the Congress, is we ought to take them all seriously. The objective is to respond to these natural disasters as well as we <POSSIBLY> can. The other issue down there for New Orleans, <OF COURSE>, is the levees. And we've got money in the supp to make sure that these levees are pre-Katrina or better prior to June 1st. I <THINK> we'll achieve that objective. There's -- additional money will be spent so that the levees are improved significantly by September of '07. The levees are important to -- the rebuilding of the levees or improving of the levees are very important to assure the people of New Orleans that if there is a storm, they're built to pre-Katrina levels, at least in the initial stage. But also it's important to convince people that it's OK to risk capital in New Orleans. The amazing thing in the area down there -- I don't <KNOW> if you all went with me, but it was -- there's -- it's a <TOTALLY> different attitude from when we were there before early on, obviously, after the storm. I mean, people are coming back. The sales tax along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi are higher today than they were a year ago this date and that's positive. But, look, there's still a lot of work to be done, a lot of reconstruction. The CDBG money -- and it's very important for the Congress to pass the CDBG money I requested so that the housing issue can get -- people can get back to rebuilding their homes. And Mississippi, the CDBG money will be coming out pretty quick. New Orleans, they still got a little work. The governor has proposed a plan that will be in front of the legislature I think this weekend. It's a very important step to getting this process moving. And so we've got a lot of work to do. But, yes, we're much more ready this time than last time and we're taking very seriously the lessons learned from Katrina."

The judge in this case, Lloyd Nash has said that he intends to appoint an independent counsel to come in and speak to Caldwell. The person that he specifically plans to appoint is Steve Sitcoff (ph) , a defense attorney here in town who has represented Aaron Sorkin (ph) in the past, in drug-related charges. Earl Caldwell objected to that, so the exact person who will be chosen remains to be seen. The prosecution had also hoped in a separate motion to remove William Jordan, a private investigator who is assisting the defense team. He had helped Mr. Blake there the past on the custody issue involving Bonny Lee Bakley. The judge has denied that motion of the prosecution, so Jordan will stay on with the team. Joining me how is Harland Braun, the defense attorney for Robert Blake during the hearing today we heard the judge chastised you for the language you used in your moving papers, among the things you did is you called Steve Coolly, the district attorney, a semi-competent district attorney and things like that.

Walker Lindh told a magistrate judge he understood the charges and that he <COULD> be sentenced to life in prison if convicted. Attorney General John Ashcroft says the United States could seek additional charges that carry the death penalty. In Afghanistan, U.S. Army special forces attacked two Taliban compounds today, killing about 12 fighters and taking 27 prisoners. The Pentagon says an American soldier was wounded, but his injury is not life-threatening. The fighting happened some 35 miles north of Kandahar. And here in Washington, supporters of campaign finance reform say they have collected 218 signatures, enough to force a vote on the issue on the House floor. No date has been set for debate and vote on the bill, which would virtually ban what's called soft money. Those are the unlimited sums that go to politicians. Campaign finance reform passed the Senate last year, but stalled in the House of Representatives. Widespread campaign donations by Enron helped fuel the move toward finance campaign reform in the House. And today, Capitol Hill began focusing on Enron's dramatic collapse. How did it happen and who knew what and when? Today, both the House and Senate opened hearings into the matter. From Capitol Hill, our congressional Kate Snow, she joins us now with more on who is talking and who is not talking -- Kate."

Blecher said he is not denying a new report that the Clippers owner is suing the NBA for damages in excess of $1 billion. His office tells us they <MAY> have something posted on their website shortly. Now, does all of this mean he's contesting the sale of the Clippers? <MAYBE>. Maybe not. Earlier today Maxwell Blecher had told us Sterling would look at the sale of the Clippers to Steve Ballmer and decide where to go from there, saying, quote, \"He doesn't want to fight with Shelly. That's the bottom line.\" That's a quote from Max Blecher to me on the phone earlier today. I don't <KNOW> what the lawsuit means versus what he said to me about contesting the sale, Wolf. Another key piece of news we have today. Sources telling us the doctors have determined Donald Sterling to be mentally incapacitated. This was a finding by two independent doctors, neurologists, presumably, we <BELIEVE>, earlier this month in two different examinations. And we have learned from one source that there is a clause in the trust between Donald and Shelly Sterling that says if one of them were to become mentally unfit, then the other would be the sole trustee. And that presumably opened the door for her to negotiate that sale with Steve Ballmer. Again, I tried to get reaction. I did get reaction from Maxwell Blecher to that finding. He said that's a vast overstatement of mental incapacitation. That this was a diagnosis really of, quote, \"modest mental impairment.\" And that maybe something akin to just slowing down mentally. And he is basically saying that mental incapacitation is not the case. At least not that degree of it."

Again, please stay safe. If that wasn't enough now, I want to get you some more information about just how big these fissures are, how close they are to home, the kind of danger they pose. Meteorologist Tom Sater is joining us from CNN headquarters in Atlanta for more on that. Tom, help us out.",
        "statement": "All right. Let's break it all down, Ana, because it's <QUITE> massive really in its scope here. This is the main chamber. OK. Kilauea, we've seen <OF COURSE> the plumes. The fissures that are opening up are releasing this energy from underground are good 20, 25 miles away., So the lava that was in the main chamber has been draining. It's been making its way underground for that 20 or 25 miles. So let's break this down, too. Each time we have one or what's leading up to these are the tremors. We've had hundreds of them. Many <AROUND> the summit and then on the east rift. And this is where the fissures have been opening up. Now we <THOUGHT> we had number 18 today. Hawaii Volcano Observatory said no, it's just 17. Because officially to have a fissure it needs to emit lava. So you can have the smoke, you can have the pressure and the gas. But it needs to emit lava. This is Leilani Estate. These are where the homes are. Notice we've got evacuation zones, we've got road closures. The green triangles are all the fissures. Now over the weekend and last week, there was no rhyme or reason to them. We've had a couple on Thursday that were to the southwest and a couple of more to the northeast. But these weekends have been the furthest to the east that we have seen which tells you that this is traveling underground until it gives. So as this lava is released, it is draining the main chamber. That's important to <KNOW> here. Take a look at this imagery that we've got from the USGS. It's a camera that looks down into the caldera. As the lava drops, which was at the top, it releases pressure so there's like landslides. There's debris that falling inside. Here is the lava on April 23rd. Now this is important because there is a fear that we <COULD> have a steam driven, massive, violent eruption if this lava drops all the way down to the water table which is at 1500 feet. Right now the lava is down almost 1200. A couple of feet a day. Another near little 3D imagery, technology is amazing here. From the USGS. they can tell us from using their high-tech cameras what this caldera or this chamber is actually shaped like. And it's getting down and tapering at the end which means debris is coming down which is going to cause pressure but it's also like packing a cannon. And when this thing goes, it's going to blow. Let's take a look another 3D area and you'll get an idea of exactly what we've been watching. So as the fissures again release the magma, we'll see the magma in the main chamber drop. If it gets down to this water level here, with all that debris inside, it doesn't mean it's going to happen but the elements are there. And if they interact just perfectly, this is where a massive eruption could occur like it did in 1924 where you had boulders that were eight tons, you know, size of a car, to 14 tons. Ana, that's like a semi tractor trailer truck that were blown a good half mile to even a mile away. So it's dropping quickly. It's a big concern. The more fissures that are expected, which will most likely happen, will drain more of that lava from the main caldera or that main chamber. So it's a little frightening but the tremors are going to continue to occur as this activity continues."

What is interesting here is that the European Union has called on these individual governments to launch their own investigations, mainly because they don't have the power to investigate further. It <SEEMS> highly <UNLIKELY> that any of these countries will do so. They will take cover under national security, saying that they won't be allowed to divulge this. There has been speculation that, in fact, a secret CIA prison was operating in both Poland and Romania. President Bush, back in September, admitted that these CIA prisons did exist. And, although they don't have any detainees in them right now, he wouldn't rule out the fact they would be used again in the future. This has really been an issue nagging at the European parliament. I <THINK> they don't want to have the taint of these kinds of secret clandestine transfers, interrogations, hanging over Europe. And so they have pushed this issue through to the parliament. As I said, there is <ABSOLUTELY> nothing that is legally binding about this. This issue, though, will continue to grind on in the European parliament. They expect to go through this report.

And so last night was the right time for him to appear. But he has a specific mission. And a lot of the subtext of his speech was aimed at younger voters, voters of color, because, as you remember, these were the constituencies that did not turn out for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and it made a critical difference in that election. Barack Obama has a connection to these voters. He's a motivating factor for these voters. And I think he's going to spend the next 12 or 11 days now speaking directly to those young people. And not just in these public appearances, but he's been a heavy presence in digital on social media in -- on channels that are -- that speak directly to these constituencies.

And what the DNI started the -- his speech with was he -- that basically he was there at the behest of President Trump. President Trump wanted him to do this. And, you know, President Trump is a master counter programmer, as we have seen for the past four years.

But what we're also hearing tonight from a company that once sold this powder to the organizer of this color play party, and that organizer has told us that the boxes that are used to ship these packets of powder are clearly labeled saying that this powder can indeed become flammable. We saw the results of that in that awful video of exactly what happened here at this water park on the weekend. And now we're facing the situation where there are 200 or so people in critical condition in hospital out of about 500 who have been injured. They're suffering not only very severe burns like the 90 percent of burns to her body of that woman that did pass away, but there are also suffering damage to their respiratory systems, to their internal organs, because they've now inhaled that powder, which we know to be flammable.",

Is there any time frame, do we know, on finding out more about how this is caused and how others can avoid it? And as I understand it, has it now been banned in Taiwan?"

Right now, the remnants of the tropical storm are moving from the U.S. into Canada. But all day long, the drenching rains flooded areas all across the northeast. The danger is far from over. At least 19 deaths are being blamed now on Irene in eight states. Flood waters are still rising in many areas. And more than 4 million homes and businesses are without power as we speak. And it could take several days to get electricity flowing to everyone again. Damage cost will likely be in the billions. President Obama is warning that many Americans aren't out of harm's way yet. He's promising swift federal assistance to victims from that storm. Irene turned out to be more of an inconvenience for major city centers like New York. Newark, LaGuardia and JFK Airports will re- open Monday morning. That's the good news. New York City will also restore subway service starting at 6:00 a.m. Eastern time. Irene may not have hit New York City as badly as many feared, but Long Island -- it caught the brunt of the storm as it passed through. Susan Candiotti is standing by in Long Beach, New York, for us.

However, the remnants are being felt, as you said. No major reports of flooding on Long Island. But, <CERTAINLY>, there is enough work here that has some people working even at this late hour. And one of the interesting questions we have is, as you indicated, is the subways will be back in business. The Long Island railroad that operates out here will be carrying a lot of people back to the city tomorrow or will they? Because after all, this is a bedroom community to New York, and as a hub for tourists as well. So, you have to wonder how much money the city has lost because of the storm. What <KIND OF> economic impact will there be because of all the preparations? I put that question to Governor Cuomo who came here to visit this afternoon."

And I always go back to the case with the woman that was jogging in Central Park that night and was basically left for dead. Everybody said, how stupid can you be to go jogging at Central Park at night? It wasn't the smartest thing in the world but certainly she didn't deserve what happened. So I am sure they are keeping their hopes up. And I am sure they don't want to hear why would she get in a car, they just are <HOPING> and praying to God that she is alive. But like you said, in a foreign country and dealing with this, and now you booked people for suspicion of murder and kidnapping, it's a tough road to hoe for these parents."

You <KNOW>, look, I mean, in terms of his testimony we'll see what he says, and we'll be able to gauge better after that testimony <OBVIOUSLY> about (Inaudible). But Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer is attempting to argue that Kurt Volker is in on his scheme to try and get the Ukrainians to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and other issues as well like 2016 election meddling. The understanding we have of what Kurt Volker's role was as far as he is concerned, is trying to help the Ukrainians navigate the sort of conflicting difficult demands with the Trump administration was putting on the new government of Volodymyr Zelensky. So, for instance, he set up a meeting after the July 25th phone call, he set up a meeting in Madrid between Giuliani and someone called Andriy Yermak who is one of President Zelensky's closest political aide. We don't know the content of their discussion were, but our understanding is, it was to, you know, to see what it was for the Trump administration really wanted. <PERHAPS> that will come out in the testimony, that's why we're all going to be watching here in the Ukraine very closely indeed."

Kim Jong-un has a team of people who is so focused is the Korean peninsula politics nuclear gamesmanship. Who Trump has briefing him preparing him for the summit is less clear. But they can't do any of that until they decide on where they're going to hold it. And it seems like a simple thing, but in fact, if you start to really think about the political implications in meeting places. Let's say Kim Jong-un wants to go to Washington or he ruled that out, you know, going to U.S. territory. No. Donald Trump ruled out going to Pyongyang. For similar reasons, he doesn't feel that security could be guaranteed there. You know, Kim Jong-un ruled out going to an aircraft carrier on the waters of the Korean peninsula. Donald Trump ruled out going to the demilitarized zone. So where does that leave us? It leaves us with trying to find a neutral location for this and there are several places in Asia that are being thrown around as possibility. Singapore and Malaysia as you see on the screen there, or also going Vietnam, Thailand also a neutral European capital like Stockholm, Sweden, Geneva, Switzerland. Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia was considered a frontrunner a few days ago. That apparently is becoming less likely possibly just because of the logistics of getting all of the international press into that country. But some of the other issues are here that Kim Jong-un apparently prefers to travel by train, much like his predecessors. He took that armored train, that luxury train to Beijing. Obviously that limits where he'd be able to go. And if he's going to fly somewhere will his jet have the fuel capacity to get in there or will he have to get a jet from another country. So, all of those logistics are being work out, and then denuclearization what is it mean for North Korea. Well, it means the American nuclear umbrella going away, it means American troops off the Korean peninsula. It means a peace treaty with South Korea. Whereas, denuclearization for the United States means North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons completely in exchange for relief from economic sanctions, normalization of relations. Two very different definitions of the term. Are they going to be able to come together, we don't know. We certainly don't know if they are going to be able to come together in a location because they haven't chosen yet. And until they know where they are going to do it, they can set a date. Donald Trump saying early June, but also indicating that it might not happen, Rosemary.",
        "statement": "It <COULD> very well prove to be the stumbling block because this, as you mention, Kim Jong-un likes and prefers to travel by train, and not only train, but a bulletproof train.

Most were directed at the sprawling Al Asad Air Base 140 miles west of Baghdad, home to hundreds of U.S. troops. Satellite images obtained by CNN show the before and after. Here, a number of buildings appear to have been destroyed or damaged next to a row of helicopters. Other buildings were also hit. Of 16 missiles launched, sources say that four appeared to have failed in flight. The president gave credit to an early warning system that the short-range missiles were incoming. U.S. intelligence satellites had picked up early signs that they'd been fueled up and then launched. Iran had also warned the Iraqi government, likely knowing that it would be passed on to the Americans, which gave U.S. troops a chance to take cover.

There's new concern this morning about ISIS. Attacks by U.S. soil by ISIS-inspired terrorists. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security are warning law enforcement personnel and the news media that they could be targeted by ISIS militants. Law enforcement officials tell CNN that a security bulletin with the warning is based on chatter and extremist forums and on social media. It's not on any specific threat. It is based on chatter. In Iraq, ISIS is advancing on Baghdad, despite further airstrikes over the weekend by the U.S.-led coalition. More than 30 suspected ISIS fighters in Iraq were killed in an air strike Saturday, on an armed convoy west of Ramadi. But officials say ISIS is moving aggressively, dispatching as many as 10,000 fighters to Anbar province from Syria and from Mosul. Standing by live in Baghdad this morning, senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman. Ben, you know, Anbar is very close to Baghdad. Do these moves by ISIS represent a serious threat to the capital?",

So, the focus of their efforts up until now has not been so much the area <AROUND> Baghdad, although they are out there and they do occasionally make hit-and-run attacks on the defensive perimeter to the west of the city. But really, their focus is on towns like Ramadi, where yesterday the police chief was killed for the entire -- the police chief for an entire province was killed in a roadside bombing; in other towns along the Euphrates River, where they clearly want to get a foothold. But Baghdad itself, at the moment, is <WELL>-defended according to U.S. officials. There is a problem, of course, of frequent car bombs. There is a car bomb at least one every day at the capital. In <FACT>, on Saturday night there were two that killed more than 40 people. So, the concern of the Iraqi security officials itself has more to do with the threat of these car bombs presumably from ISIS within the city and not so much as these occasional probing attacks on this city's defense -- Christine."

My kids are a little bit older than Vivek's. Mine are going to be in 10th, eighth, and sixth grades. And I think we'll start to get a little bit more granular about very young kids versus high school kids versus college kids. I do think there's differences in terms of the likelihood of getting sick, the likelihood of spread. If you start looking at contact tracing studies, for example, from other countries, you do find that the risk of transmissibility is lower among kids to themselves and to older people. But it's not zero. The thing that strikes me about this is that if you look at the studies, what is the impact overall of shutting down schools? How much of an impact does that make on society? And they say it's about two percent to four percent according to some of these studies in terms of reduction of the spread, the reduction of hospitalizations and deaths. If you're in a place where you're already having thousands of new people get infected every day, two to four percent of that is a large number. That's the thing. If you had a smaller number of new infections or if the cases were at least going in a downward trend like where you guys are up in New York, I think it would be a much better situation. Where I'm here in Georgia, where Vivek, I think you're still in Florida, it's a tougher sort of thing to ascertain. I don't know.

Sorry. Well, keeping them honest, that's also not true. They didn't stay in the locker room, when it became abundantly <CLEAR> that the event had been canceled more for lack of the Eagles than anything else, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders then tried a little gaslighting, saying, quote: The vast majority of the Eagles team decided to abandon their fans.

And now Donald Trump Jr. agreeing to sit down to be questioned. Of course, the question going forward is, what is the line of inquiry here? Are they concerned that he was not truthful before the committee when he appeared weeks ago? Is it possible they want to test his statements to see if he committed perjury then? Of course, the other question is, what more do they want to learn about what was a central part of the Russia investigation? And that is that Trump Tower meeting in June 2016, where he was interested and the campaign was interested in receiving foreign help, dirt on Hillary Clinton, from Russia. Yes, the special counsel concluded that there was no conspiracy between the two sides but it did cite a number of instances, like this one, to speak to contacts and interests and, as the special counsel said, you'll remember in that report, that there was interest from the Trump campaign in receiving that help.

Let's talk about all of this and more with \"Washington Post\" columnist, the associate editor, David Ignatius; the chief political correspondent for \"Slate,\" Jamelle Bouie; \"TIME\" magazine political reporters Zeke Miller; and our CNN national political reporter Maeve Reston. Maeve, the Hillary Clinton campaign put out their own statement in response to Jeb Bush's \"anchor baby\" comments. Let me read it to our viewers. \"If Republicans continue to wonder how to label these children, Hillary has already made it clear to them they are not anchor babies; they are babies. They are our neighbors. They are our families.\" what about this term? How is it playing out there on the campaign trail, Jeb obviously -- Jeb Bush sticking with it?",

Because <CERTAINLY> he more than anyone else <KNOWS> that is considered an offensive term to a lot of people out there. But this is <DEFINITELY> a fight that Hillary Clinton wants to have. You saw her come out on Twitter not once but a couple of times on this issue. She's looking to bring Latinos into her campaign. <OBVIOUSLY>, there will be a huge fight in states like Colorado and Nevada over those voters next year. And right now she wants to do as much as she can to brand Jeb Bush with <SORT OF> the Donald Trump brush. Because obviously, Donald Trump has offended a lot of Latinos with his comments about immigration, whereas Bush is trying to say, \"Hey, I'm the guy that can reach out to Latinos. I'm the candidate that you actually want up against Hillary Clinton next year.\" So it's turning into a very interesting debate over these issues and one that's <PROBABLY> good for Jeb Bush, honestly, because it's sharpening him up a little bit and getting him out there punching."

What the reports show is that      he wasn't wearing a bulky jacket; he'd entered the tube station, he'd      entered normally, he'd been followed from his house and that, you know,      he was actually restrained before being shot seven times in the head.

In the days when I first came to Washington, if we had been running a $160 billion surplus when the economy had a 0 percent growth rate, the so-called Keynesians would have been saying, \"You're out of your mind.\" You ought to have at least a $200 billion tax cut because, instead of taking money away from the American people when the economy is running slow, we ought to give them back more money than they sent in. You know, so it's really quite paradoxical that people are wringing their hands when we're running $160 billion surplus, that they don't think it's enough. I think it's really quite good that we're able to run $160 billion surplus when we have effectively zero growth in the economy or something close to that.

It will also raise questions about role, how prominent a role religious clerics will play in the new Iraq. But that other issue, federalism, is emerging as an impasse. The Kurds want explicit reference to it in the constitution, maintaining an autonomous region in the north. The Sunnis want all talk of federalism sidelined until a new government comes into power. And the Shia are perhaps split. Some of them are calling for an autonomous region in the country's south. Others are calling for a unified, single Iraq.

The other thing is that -- you shouldn`t forget that along the graph that you`ve just shown of arrests on the U.S./Mexico border, Mexico in the first six months of 2019 has also been doing an important part of this, which is deporting back to Central American countries almost 75,000 central American migrants. So, Mexico has not been sitting on its hands either. The problem is, Christiane, you can`t enforce your way out of a migration crisis. This is going to take time, it`s going to take commitment, it`s going to take resources, and it`s going to take addressing some of the drivers of these transmigration trends from Central America into Mexico and on their way to the United States, mainly public insecurity and some of the effects of the draw up per the climate change patterns that are hitting rural parts of the Northern Triangle countries, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which is <SORT OF> driving a combination of urban migration, fleeing and security, and rural migration, fleeing lack of economic opportunities."

Other authorities from other countries involved in the investigation have also thrown out a bit of information. This latest information coming from Malaysian authorities that are showing two different routes that potentially this plane may have taken. It may have gone north or may have gone south into the southern portion of the Indian Ocean. Let's talk about Kazakhstan. You are familiar with that region and how mountainous it is. If that plane were to have enough fuel to get there intentionally, if it were able to land in the general region, what would this mean based on some of the sources you have and people you talked to? What would this potentially mean that this plane would have some intention possibly to go to that region?",

One would imagine if a group had taken a plane lot of people hostage, there would be demands for the release of these people. Would it be a group and there is no basis for us to be at the support. Would they be trying to extort something? What we <KNOW> about the track or at least the <BEST> estimate that they would have gone from Northern Thailand and Miramar and across the west of China to the plateau across the desert through the Turkestan's airspace and on to Kazakhstan's airspace. Where it is on the track is <KIND OF> what's interesting partly about this track that it flew. They <THOUGHT> it <MAY> have flown across western chine. China, one would expect them through the radar system to be able to pick up unidentified aircraft and respond to it. It would have intersected with what was a hijacking a year and a half ago in December of 2012. It was blamed on Uighurs on a flight flying across that western bit of China. Again, it's hard to get substantial details. There is a Uighur community and tensions between the north and the south between the ethnic groups. A very mountainous country for <SURE>. The places to land the planes would be tough. Kazakhstan may be easier to land an aircraft there, but again a government that substantially had resources and you expect them to have a long reach in terms of radar or know what's going on there."

We are, of course, now hearing these live pictures from Baghdad air raid sirens. If things unfold in Baghdad the way they usually do, it looks like we're first seeing the first AAA antiartillery aircraft artillery possibly go off. The Iraqis have a long history in these types of events of very quickly turning on their air raid sirens looking at these live pictures, turning on their antiaircraft authority, basically shooting a wall of steel into the sky if they believe U.S. aircraft or U.S. Tomahawk missiles are coming at them. I suspect as this begins to unfold, we will see more activity in the sky. We can tell you it is a well-known fact, U.S. B-52 bombers took off from England earlier today. We are not saying their destination. We are not saying their flying time. We're not saying where they're going. They often take off on various missions. They may or may not be involved in what will unfold over Baghdad. Continuing to look at these pictures, it's not unexpected that we will continue to see air activity over Baghdad. The U.S. administration, of course -- it looks like another tracer there off to the right of your screen. The U.S. administration struggling with when to exactly begin the air bombardment of Baghdad. They had been hoping all the way along that the Iraqi military would basically revolt against the regime of Saddam Hussein, a very heavy propaganda campaign, of course, going on in the last days here, trying to convince the Iraqi military that they had no hope of winning, even rumors in the last several hours that a Republican Guard division was ready to defect. So there had been a sense of maybe waiting a bit, seeing if the Iraqi military would basically give up, seeing if the leadership would turn against Saddam Hussein. The last two nights of their airstrikes we have seen over Baghdad have, in fact, been very much aimed at leadership, military targets aimed at Saddam Hussein, his family, his top advisers. They had called them, you know, decapitation strikes, but now it looks like other things could be unfolding in the hours ahead -- Wolf.",

They're <HOPING> to knock down <PERHAPS> a cruise missile. They're firing. They have indications, presumably from their radar, that U.S., British aircraft as <WELL>, are in the skies approaching Baghdad or hovering over the skies. Let's listen a little bit more to this fire that's going on. Our military analyst David Grange, retired U.S. brigadier general, is with us as <WELL>. General Grange, tell our viewers what you sense is happening right now."

Now he's <SORT OF> -- he's making calls on where the market <MAY> go. I thought that was <QUITE> interesting. But the third point is the currency. That's also caused a huge amount of concern worldwide. There was a devaluation of the Chinese Yuan after the authorities let it be more focused on market forces. The Yuan has fallen. He is now saying that it is at a fair value, about 3% lower than it was, that's also key. Now whether it stays that way remains to be seen. He's talking about market forces, reforms.

        "previous_statement": "Now, the president has put Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill in charge of working with Congress on this mix of tax cuts and spending increases to try to the stimulate economy. Paul O'Neill, the treasury secretary, was here on Capitol Hill a little while ago at a hearing, outlined some of the principles. They are, first of all, a price tag. For the first time, the administration saying they would like to see a stimulus plan that would total between 60 and 75 billion dollars. They have three major components here. One, for individuals, some mix of possibly accelerated tax cuts, possibly accelerating those tax cuts that Congress has already passed. And by the way, I believe we have pictures now of the president just arriving back in the Washington area at Andrews Air Force Base, coming out of Air Force One. Again, the three major principles of this economic stimulus plan that the president is talking about. One, accelerated tax cuts for individuals to try to get consumers buying again. Also, tax cuts for businesses. And finally financial support, direct financial support for those that have been directly affected by the September 11th attacks. Now, meanwhile when Treasury Secretary O'Neill was up here on Capitol Hill -- there's Bush going into Marine One, headed back toward the White House. When the treasury secretary was up here on Capitol Hill, he said that the economy -- he sees clear signs that the economy is starting to get back on the right foot. And that's a very important point, because what we've learned about those rebate checks that went out, which were supposed to be economic stimulus checks, those $300 rebate checks that went out to individuals, is that the Treasury Department says only about 18 percent of that money was actually put back into the economy. With the economic slowdown, individuals were saving that money, not spending it: therefore, not much economic stimulus. So what Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill trying to do on Capitol Hill here is also to try to reinvigorate faith in the American economy, because without consumer confidence, all this question of economic stimulus probably won't have much effect, because individuals, not confident about the economy, may not go out and spend the economic stimulus. Much debate going on here about this as we go forward -- Judy.",

The other thing that we have to look at is to know that, in fact, mothers are very important for children, but other social experiences also are important, opportunities to interact with other children, opportunities to interact with other adults, be that fathers, be that grandparents, and also child care providers. Children learn from these social experiences. Of course, the mother is important, but few people in this country believe that only the mother is important. We've had a long history of children going to nursery school. Very, very few children actually have experiences only with the mother. When I was a kindergarten teacher 25 years ago, the children that I actually worried about the most were children who had never been around other children or other caregivers. They came to school at a real disadvantage. And I think that pretending that only the mother is important for children is a mistake.",
        "statement": "Well, in study indicates that. I mean, what it reflects is that children who have not been <AROUND> other children in a child care situation, <APPARENTLY>, don't have skills for dealing with other children. They show abnormally low percentage of aggression in this study."

I think the other question that Senator Warner left out is not only how high this goes, but how broadly, how wide this goes. Because, this, while coming clearly under the umbrella of a Russian effort to help the candidate, Trump, is around a fairly narrow set of questions. It does not, at least on the last information we have so far, which is probably not the last war we're going to have in this meeting. At least on the information we have so far does not yet implicate the question of either the hacking of the DNC and John Podesta's e-mail and or which I think is also an important area of investigation that the role of Russian agencies in spreading fake news and you know, misleading news stories targeted into key states in the U.S. election. And whether they had any help in deciding where from Moscow to target those efforts. I mean, those are, in many ways, the broader questions that most of the public is still focused on. This meeting at this point does not yet address that. But one thing I feel pretty confident about is that, as these stories have shifted, it's just under the glare of the news media. Once people start testifying under oath and documents are subpoenaed, it is likely our understanding of what happened in that initial meeting is going to be different at the end than it is today.",

What <SEEMS> to have happened, why this took so long is there was that one precinct with results that <APPARENTLY> the state headquarters didn't tabulate. I spoke myself to the now famous Edith Pfeffer, the chairwoman of the Clinton County Republicans, spoke with her. She said, hey, we turned in those results not long after 7:00, sometime <AROUND> 7:40, 7:50. The problem, guys, seems to be that there were some tabulating issues here in Des Moines with the state headquarters. I <GUESS> they didn't realize that they didn't have those numbers. And this <MIGHT> happen a lot in elections. Usually it all gets squared away the next day. But, <OF COURSE>, here we were with an election resting on just a handful of votes. So every single precinct mattered. And when they discovered they were missing a couple, we had to wait and track down each one. Also, and then you can see and you're hearing video from, of course, all of the various candidate parties. Zoraida and Ashleigh, it was so interesting because here were these ballrooms full of supporters all night waiting to see their candidates, and the candidates really weren't <SURE> what to say for a while, especially Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney.

We have important advice on jobs and how to hang on to the biggest investment of your life. YOUR BOTTOM LINE starts now. We'll get to your jobs in just a minute, but first, details of President Obama's foreclosure prevention program are now public. You can see them at hud.gov. Look under the tab that says \"Making Home Affordable.\" And here's the big picture, the plan has two initiatives. The first is for people underwater in their mortgage. Who qualifies? Well, if you are current, but can't refinance because of falling home prices, you could be in line for some help. The loan must be held by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Ask your lender. Now, what it does for you is it allows you to refinance into a loan with lower monthly payments or avoid a big fat rate reset. There's no principle reduction but you could save money over the life of your loan. Now, the second imitative is designed to help lower monthly payments for homeowners at risk of foreclosure. These loan modifications work by reducing interest rates. The new interest rate is in place for five years, after that it resets higher each and every year for five years. This program also includes a new provision that would eliminate borrower's second mortgages. Now, you qualify, if you're behind on mortgage payments. The mortgage must be for your primary home, it can't be an investment. The monthly mortgage bill must be more than 31 percent of your monthly gross income. To get ready, here's what you'll need: Put together the proof of your income, these are your W-2s, your most recent income tax return, second mortgage documents if you have it, credit card payment proof. This is critical and information on other loans including student loans, car loans, whatever you got. Now, whether or not you can afford your house is critical to your financial health, but so is your job, if you're lucky to have one these days. If you don't, or you're looking to trade up to a better job, you'll want to listen up. Jennifer Merritt is the career editor for the \"Wall Street Journal\" and Manisha Thakor is a personal finance expert and auditor of \"On My Own Two Feet.\" Great to see both of you guys. You know, there's a lot of conversation about the best places to go for jobs. And I think all of us have had the experience of sending out resumes to a million different places and nothing happens.

        "statement": "The new way is to remember that your time is money. And I <THINK> people need to be really strategic. I suggest going to trade organizations or reading blogs and writing to people who are talking specifically about the area of your interest.

In the process of reaching out to the world's 1.5 billion Muslims with today's speech, it's unclear if President Obama, in the process, was also pushing away America's longtime ally, Israel. Speaking in Cairo, the president recognized the U.S.' \"unbreakable bond\" with the Jewish state and the horror of the Holocaust, but he also talked about the suffering of the Palestinian people. He described their situation as intolerable, and he stressed the need for a two-state solution. President Obama called on Palestinians to abandon violence, pointing to America's own civil rights history and saying that it was a peaceful and determined insistence that brought about equal rights for African-Americans. And he once again called upon Israel to stop building the settlements and to allow Palestinians to live and work and develop their own society. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already rejected President Obama's call for a freeze on those settlements, but experts suggest that this demand from Mr. Obama will make the Arab world listen. They say although the U.S. has been opposed to Israeli settlements for decades, past American presidents have looked the other way and allowed Israel to just keep building them. And some believe that if \"no\" really means \"no\" this time around, well, it may be easier to form a regional coalition against Iran. And speaking of Iran, Mr. Obama repeated his belief today the Islamic republic has the right to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes. That's another statement that's probably not going to sit real well with the Israelis. And finally, for the first time in a long time, a visit to the Middle East by a sitting U.S. president did not include a stop in Israel. So here's the question: Is President Obama reaching out to Muslims at the expense of America's relationship with Israel? Go to cnn.com/caffertyfile and post a comment on my blog. Pretty big stuff.",

The Trump administration defends the alleged effort by Jared Kushner to set up secret backchannel links with the Russians, calling that normal and acceptable, but a former CIA director calls it off the map; and Democrats are calling for a review of the security clearance for the president's son-in-law. Broken trust. After meeting with President Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel says Europe can no longer completely rely on others; and Germany's foreign minister says President Trump's actions have put Europe's peace at risk. Is a crucial alliance on rocks? Democratic terrorism? Domestic terrorism. The FBI is investigating a violent attack on a commuter train after two men are killed trying to stop a man yelling anti-Muslim slurs at two young women. The president tweets that the victim stood up to hate and intolerance. Was this a hate crime and domestic terrorism? And catastrophic war. North Korea launches its third missile in three weeks as Defense Secretary James Mattis warns a conflict with North Korea could be catastrophic. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. President Trump honors America's fallen on this Memorial Day, laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns and visiting the graves of service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. But as the commander in chief considers boosting America's battle against terrorism, the White House is now on the defensive amid growing questions about contacts with Russia, including what sources say was an effort by the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to set up a pre-inauguration secret backchannel link to Russia. While a former CIA director finds that move appalling, homeland security secretary John Kelly says it's no big deal. Sources say the White House is preparing a war room to combat the growing number of allegations and leaks as multiple Russia investigations gather momentum. And new controversies are arising from the president's recent overseas trip. After meetings dominated by friction with President Trump over climate, trade and defense, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, says Europeans must, quote, \"take our fate into our own hands,\" while her foreign minister says President Trump's actions are putting Europe's peace at risk. I'll talk to Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego, an Iraq War veteran. He's on the Armed Services Committee. And our correspondents, specialists and guests, they're standing by with full coverage of the day's top stories. President Trump's son-in-law is the lightning rod as a new storm batters the White House. Top officials are rushing to downplay allegations that Jared Kushner wanted to establish a secret link to Russia back during the transition. Let's begin with CNN's Diane Gallagher. Diane, what are you learning?",
        "statement": "Yes, <WELL>, Wolf this <MAY> have actually been the reason that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump cut their portion of the overseas trip short. The official White House line was the couple always planned to head back home after the Vatican visit, but sources are now telling CNN that Kushner knew the story was <ABOUT> to break and didn't want to be standing with his father-in-law on a foreign trip when it did."

And as we continue, this is CNN and on this network the news always comes first.

Rescuers are now <HOPING> to reach at least one person who <MAY> <POSSIBLY> still be alive. The quake has killed at least 250 people across central Mexico. Officials say the island of Dominica has gone into survival mode after being hit by hurricane Maria. People are in desperate need of food, water and medical supplies. Even the Prime Minister's homeless. At least 15 people on the island are known to have died in the storm. President Trump has announced new sanctions against North Korea targeting firms and individuals who trade with the country. He also says China has ordered to stop its banks doing business with Pyongyang. No official response from China's central bank. The Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, took a dig at the United States during the United Nations on Thursday. Saying there is no country on the planet that can walkway from the challenge and reality of climate change. Remember, President Trump announced in July he's pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Kenya says it's moving the new presidential election to October the 26th. The country's Supreme Court annulled last month's election. President Uhuru Kenyatta says that amounted to a coup. His opponent, Raila Odinga called it fraudulent. Wall Street's winning streak has come to an end. The Dow briefly had an intraday high and then it fell back -- very briefly. Look at it. Right at the beginning of the day. A smidgeon of green on the top left of your screen. Things turned thereafter. It was off 53 points, ending nine straight days of gains and seven days of record closures. The S&P and Nasdaq both closed slightly lower, as well. Let's put this into context. The Dow is still up 30 percent for the year and is closed at a record of 42 times since the beginning of the year. The IMF's managing director says she's worried about complacency as markets hit record after record and economies enjoy steady growth. Christine Lagarde is warning there's a whole generation that is yet to experience a serious market correction. Speaking to me, she urged governments to make structural changes now and ensure a rising economic tide lifts all countries."

And there is a weather warning in effect for shipping off the coast of northeastern China due to thick sea ice. Mari Ramos has more, she joins us now from the world weather center -- Mari.",
        "statement": "Hey, Kristie. Good to see you. You <KNOW> what, sometimes -- well, you know, this time of year you'd expect to see sea ice, right, in many areas across northeastern China. The thing is that this time <AROUND> we're talking about some of the thickest in <QUITE> a long time. Let's go ahead and look at the pictures first of all, and then I'll show you which part of the world we're talking about. So this is an (inaudible) in Lazhou Bay in eastern China, just near Shandong Province. And just off the water here you can see how thick the ice actually is. Well, this is a problem, particularly for shipping because <OF COURSE> both cannot get in and out of the harbor. There are hundreds of boats that are literally stuck in that very thick ice and some of those boats can be permanently damaged because of the ice. Now one of the questions that comes up -- there you see the boats stuck in the ice -- that comes up often is also fishing. What happens with the fishing industry? Well, there's a lot of areas there for fishing that -- where they have fish farms, for example. Well, most of the farmers had actually finished their harvest already this year. Usually they finish that by the end of December. So they don't <THINK> that those areas will be affected. But, you know, you can see it there, pretty significant. Come back over to the weather map. This is a very busy area across northeastern China. We're talking in that northwestern corner of the Yellow Sea, in the Bohai Sea. And right over here you can actually see it on this visible satellite image from NASA the extent of the thick ice, in some cases over 125 kilometers. This is not the thickest that they've ever measures, or the widest that they've ever measured. They actually had more ice back in 2010. So this is the second time in two years where we have something so significant. And you guys in Beijing and Seoul, you know what I'm talking about. But it has been so cold over the last couple of weeks. And that of course has helped create that sea ice that you see there. Minus 4 now in Tokyo. The situation in Japan is going to be more snowfall on the way for you after all the snow that you had over the weekend, also very strong winds expected here as another push of cold air continues to move across the northeastern portion of the continent. This is what it looks like on the satellite as you can see here. Another area I want to talk to you about is as we head farther to the south, this is Indonesia. Over the weekend reports coming out of this area, particularly near Jakarta, of some very heavy rain. Well, this rain I don't think it's really associated to Tropical Cyclone Iggy, that storm is way down here to the south nearing the coast of Australia. However, this time of year we are talking about the wettest time of the year here across this part of world, anywhere from Papua New Guinea, which we had landslides last week, back over toward Indonesia of course, and peninsular parts of Malaysia. So <DEFINITELY> something to monitor. The other thing is, of course, is our Tropical Cyclone Iggy right here off the coast of Australia. Even though high waves have been a concern and even some scattered showers, the center of the storm itself is expected to stay out at sea and not have a direct impact here on this western coast of Australia. I want to switch gears completely and give you a brief update on what's happening in Europe, because this is also another big story, a lot going on. The heavy snowfalls across eastern Europe finally coming to an end. You look at the snow banks, Kristie, in some cases several meters high here. The snow coming to an end, but that Arctic high pressure will spread that cold air all the way into western Europe -- London, even today you were struggling to get out of freezing. Paris, you <MIGHT> not even get out of freezing over the next couple of days. Back to you."

So Donald Trump brought that message into liberal urban Chicago. It simply was not welcome there. Most of the places he campaigns across the country have loud adoring supporters, we've seen him across the south and other places. But this is like coming into the belly of the beast, the liberal beast. They simply did not want Donald Trump's message here. So I think that a lot of the response was just the chance for Chicago and the democrats here, there is a democratic primary going on to just say no, we don't want Donald Trump. So in a sense it was a preview of what <COULD> be a general election contest. I mean, if Donald Trump <THINKS> that he can make Illinois competitive, if he thinks he can make Michigan competitive <SHOULD> he become the nominee this is what we could see. But I was struck just the earnestness of the protest. We talked to one demonstrator, one man who lived in the neighborhood where this rally was supposed to be going on. And this is why he said he came out to protest."

The -- John Cox, the business man, will face Gavin Newsom, former San Francisco mayor, for the governorship. And in the Senate race, Dianne Feinstein, it's not clear who she will face, whether it will be somebody from her left, Kevin de Leon, or Jim Bradley, a businessman from Orange County. The other concern that Democrats here had, they were targeting ten different districts of Republican, trying to flip those seats. Seven of them are seats where -- where -- Republicans where Hillary Clinton won those districts. They were concerned they were going to get locked out of one, two, possibly three. It looks like, in all of those districts, that Democrats will be No. 2 in all of them. There are two that are still somewhat of a question. Number -- District 10, Jeff Denham, the Republican, will face either Josh Harder or Ted Howze. And in the 48th, there are two Democrats and a Republican vying for that No. 2 spot. All of this could take some time to figure out, because in one case, 188,000 were left off the voter rolls in Los Angeles County, so they had to fill out paper ballots. Those had to be counted. And mail-in ballots. People could walk up on election day and even mail them in on election day. Those will take time to count.

And as you mentioned, Bank of America and Merrill Lynch went from a three to six-month time horizon to six to nine months today, and that seems to be the big needle mover.",

In the last hours, we hear from Mommy herself, Mommy`s journal, in which she details her innermost thoughts and feelings about how she`s going to shoot her children dead. Let`s take a look at what Mommy said in her own writing. This is what I observed in court. Mommy now has her hair pulled back, mousey brown, in a bun. She won`t look at any of the witnesses. She won`t turn around and look at her husband, Colonel Parker Schenecker. She sits there acting like she`s taking notes, as if nothing`s going on around her. But let`s take a look into Mommy`s life. Let`s see the screens, Liz - - what we learned that Mommy writes in her journal. I did all my duties. Then I went to buy a gun. I was planning a Saturday massacre, but had to wait for a background investigation for three days. Let`s keep it going. Calyx called me pathetic. On Saturday, she called me an evil soul. The evil starts Thursday. Calyx, you know what? She gets it first. Don`t know whether I`ll turn on the light (to blind) or just react to have me in her bedroom. I`m nervous. Next -- I offed Beau on the way to practice. I offed Beau on the way to practice. He saw the gun and told me to put it back in the purse. He had a healthy fight, then when we got home, a shot to his mouth (because) he became so mouthy, just like Calyx. Calyx drove me to drink. He (Beau) was yelling at me. The first shot hit the windshield. Second shot was the side of his head. Next shot to the mouth, his mouthy mouth. Came home. Calyx is on the upstairs computer. Asked, What are you doing? Just (seeing) what you are doing, walked up without her reacting and shot her in the right temple. Then shot her in the mouth (her sassy little mouth). Really tore my soul to the core. Shot the two mouthy mouths in the mouth after shooting them in the head. I`m just losing my mind. I`d like to die by Beau in our bed. That would be nice. Beau and I are going to heaven. Wish heaven for Calyx, too. \"Wish.\" Whoa! Lucky you weren`t there -- talking to her husband. Probably would have offed you, too. Would have been a crying shame. I sensed divorce was inevitable, but I can`t live alone.\" All right, straight out to Roger Schulman, Tampa radio reporter in court today, Roger with me in the courtroom all day yesterday.

So it does contribute a lot of money to the United States. It does hire a lot of Americans. And to go back to your <QUESTION> <ABOUT> how WHO handled China, it's true they <TEND> to pander to China. They are a major member of the U.N. and of the Security Council and we <ALL> remember those photos of Dr. Travers (ph), the head of WHO, going to sit with President Xi.

And so look, as many Americans, I want to make sure people with preexisting conditions are able to get health care. But as a Republican, I also believe to mandate someone to carry health care coverage and to penalize them if they don't is wrong. And so hopefully the two parties will come together, and cooler heads will prevail, and in a nonelection year they'll try to work this out. They only fell one vote shy of getting this changed anyway in the Senate. And so with a new makeup of the Senate, a bigger majority in the Senate, hopefully the two side will come together and we'll get a better, somewhat of the same bill, but tweak it. Make it better. And try to take off some of these provisions where we mandate, for example, someone carry health care coverage and penalize them if they don't have it.",

But there are those that are very strategic at the moment, looking at Joe Biden's momentum and <THINKING> about who is <BEST> suited to beat Donald Trump.

And al Qaeda's silence is leaving investigators uneasy as they try to guess where the terror network will strike next. What's al Qaeda up to? That's the focus of Michael Elliott's piece in the latest edition of \"TIME\" magazine. Michael joins us now live from New York. I want to read one excerpt, Michael, from your excellent article that you have in \"TIME\" this week. \"There could be another al Qaeda cell out there just as good, just as quiet as the one that mounted the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\" Specifically, Michael, what are you talking about?",
        "statement": "Well, one of the extraordinary things that we've discovered, Wolf, is that in all the hundreds of interviews of al Qaeda detainees that have been done, in all the mountains of documents that we took away from Afghanistan and went through, in all the computer diskettes that were examined, we have found essentially no record of the September 11 hijackers. What that, <OF COURSE>, makes investigators concerned about is the possibility that there's another cell that's just as good. One of the questions that investigators have to concern themselves with is what's more frightening, noise, chatter as they call it in the intelligence field, the things that they hear, the things that they pick up in telephone intercepts, or silence. And the extraordinary <FACT> that we can find virtually no signals or human intelligence of the September the 11th hijackers, the 19, has really got people worried that there <MAY> be others out there who are just as good."

Well, CNN has learned that federal authorities down in Arkansas are now actively investigating the Clinton family foundation for public corruption -- alleged public corruption. A U.S. official tells me that the FBI and federal prosecutors down in Little Rock are specifically digging into whether foundation donors were improperly promised policy favors or special access to Clinton while she was secretary of state in exchange for donations to the charity's coffers. They're examining whether non-profit tax laws were followed. CNN reported back in November of 2016 that the FBI had opened preliminary inquiries into whether there had been any sort of impropriety with the foundation's dealings and money and that caused some tensions within the bureau and the Justice Department. And so, the current inquiry, at least in part, as a continuation of that probe, that originated before the presidential election, but what's unclear is precisely what new evidence, if any, ignited the current federal investigation after those initial inquiries were stalled. Now the Clinton camp is pushing back very hard against this news as Nick Merrill, a spokesman, for Clinton told me. Let's call this what it is, a sham, and a spokesperson for the Clinton Foundation said the Clinton Foundation has been subjected to politically motivated allegations and time after time those allegations have been proven false. Nevertheless, this probe comes in the midst of a really sensitive time for the Justice Department under this administration as the president continues to demand time after time that his political rival be investigated while the Justice Department stays silent -- Ana.",

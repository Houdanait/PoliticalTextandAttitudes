    "statement": "Dramatic developments today in the Enron collapse, as Congress begins hearings. We'll get to that in just a moment. But now a check at this hour's latest developments: The American accused of joining al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan made his first court appearance today. John Walker Lindh is charged with four criminal counts, including conspiracy to kill Americans. Walker Lindh told a magistrate judge he understood the charges and that he <COULD> be sentenced to life in prison if convicted. Attorney General John Ashcroft says the United States could seek additional charges that carry the death penalty. In Afghanistan, U.S. Army special forces attacked two Taliban compounds today, killing about 12 fighters and taking 27 prisoners. The Pentagon says an American soldier was wounded, but his injury is not life-threatening. The fighting happened some 35 miles north of Kandahar. And here in Washington, supporters of campaign finance reform say they have collected 218 signatures, enough to force a vote on the issue on the House floor. No date has been set for debate and vote on the bill, which would virtually ban what's called soft money. Those are the unlimited sums that go to politicians. Campaign finance reform passed the Senate last year, but stalled in the House of Representatives. Widespread campaign donations by Enron helped fuel the move toward finance campaign reform in the House. And today, Capitol Hill began focusing on Enron's dramatic collapse. How did it happen and who knew what and when? Today, both the House and Senate opened hearings into the matter. From Capitol Hill, our congressional Kate Snow, she joins us now with more on who is talking and who is not talking -- Kate."

We have many two- parent households in this country that it takes both families -- both of the parents working to keep the families out of poverty and with a good wage. This study, if you're just thinking about hours, we did not look at in this particular report what happens when you're putting -- subjecting children to living in poverty. And I think that's got to be part of the equation. The other thing that we have to look at is to know that, in fact, mothers are very important for children, but other social experiences also are important, opportunities to interact with other children, opportunities to interact with other adults, be that fathers, be that grandparents, and also child care providers. Children learn from these social experiences. Of course, the mother is important, but few people in this country believe that only the mother is important. We've had a long history of children going to nursery school. Very, very few children actually have experiences only with the mother. When I was a kindergarten teacher 25 years ago, the children that I actually worried about the most were children who had never been around other children or other caregivers. They came to school at a real disadvantage. And I think that pretending that only the mother is important for children is a mistake.",

We're going to have full analysis afterwards. We're also going to be able to speak with the president's deputy national security adviser, Dennis McDonough, and try to fill in some of the blanks. No doubt, the president will say a lot that will sort of cry out for more questioning. We'll hear what they have to say about all these. Most important, David Gergen, right now we want specifics.

Both Sanders and Clinton spent Friday crisscrossing that key Keystone State, which has the most delegates up for grabs on Tuesday when voters in five states are going to go to the polls. Sanders is behind Clinton in Pennsylvania by almost 30 points, according to a new poll there, and he spent the day campaigning in Maryland and Delaware. Clinton was in Connecticut and Rhode Island. And Pam, those are all states that vote on Tuesday.",
    "statement": "<OF COURSE>. And you pointed out some differences in the <KIND OF> events Clinton and Sanders are holding. What's behind those differences?"

    "previous_statement": "Breaking news coming into THE SITUATION ROOM, involving a possible lawsuit Donald Sterling may be filing against the NBA. Brian Todd has been out front of the story since it began. He's working his sources. He's joining us now with the breaking details. What are you learning?",
    "statement": "Wolf, the moving parts never stop moving in this story. I've been in contact with his attorney, Donald Sterling's attorney, Maxwell Blecher, this afternoon via e-mail. Blecher said he is not denying a new report that the Clippers owner is suing the NBA for damages in excess of $1 billion. His office tells us they <MAY> have something posted on their website shortly. Now, does all of this mean he's contesting the sale of the Clippers? <MAYBE>. Maybe not. Earlier today Maxwell Blecher had told us Sterling would look at the sale of the Clippers to Steve Ballmer and decide where to go from there, saying, quote, \"He doesn't want to fight with Shelly. That's the bottom line.\" That's a quote from Max Blecher to me on the phone earlier today. I don't <KNOW> what the lawsuit means versus what he said to me about contesting the sale, Wolf. Another key piece of news we have today. Sources telling us the doctors have determined Donald Sterling to be mentally incapacitated. This was a finding by two independent doctors, neurologists, presumably, we <BELIEVE>, earlier this month in two different examinations. And we have learned from one source that there is a clause in the trust between Donald and Shelly Sterling that says if one of them were to become mentally unfit, then the other would be the sole trustee. And that presumably opened the door for her to negotiate that sale with Steve Ballmer. Again, I tried to get reaction. I did get reaction from Maxwell Blecher to that finding. He said that's a vast overstatement of mental incapacitation. That this was a diagnosis really of, quote, \"modest mental impairment.\" And that maybe something akin to just slowing down mentally. And he is basically saying that mental incapacitation is not the case. At least not that degree of it."

    "previous_statement": "Yes, I think they're looking at the data. They're looking at -- even if you put the protocols into place, what's the likelihood of having a problem, having a cluster of cases develop? And what are we getting in return for it? What's the risk/reward proposition, decisions, discussions that we have been having since the beginning of this. I want my kids to go back to school as well. My kids are a little bit older than Vivek's. Mine are going to be in 10th, eighth, and sixth grades. And I think we'll start to get a little bit more granular about very young kids versus high school kids versus college kids. I do think there's differences in terms of the likelihood of getting sick, the likelihood of spread. If you start looking at contact tracing studies, for example, from other countries, you do find that the risk of transmissibility is lower among kids to themselves and to older people. But it's not zero. The thing that strikes me about this is that if you look at the studies, what is the impact overall of shutting down schools? How much of an impact does that make on society? And they say it's about two percent to four percent according to some of these studies in terms of reduction of the spread, the reduction of hospitalizations and deaths. If you're in a place where you're already having thousands of new people get infected every day, two to four percent of that is a large number. That's the thing. If you had a smaller number of new infections or if the cases were at least going in a downward trend like where you guys are up in New York, I think it would be a much better situation. Where I'm here in Georgia, where Vivek, I think you're still in Florida, it's a tougher sort of thing to ascertain. I don't know. We'll see over the next several weeks, but unless the numbers go in the right direction, I think it's going to be tough for the schools to reopen in any kind of normal way.",

Will they talk about whether there can be the rapid-fire testing, and what happens if somebody is positive? Is that why they're revising the guidelines, or what do you expect to see now?"

And it's tough out there. And the two things so important to you, your job and your house could be headed for a tough stretch. We have important advice on jobs and how to hang on to the biggest investment of your life. YOUR BOTTOM LINE starts now. We'll get to your jobs in just a minute, but first, details of President Obama's foreclosure prevention program are now public. You can see them at hud.gov. Look under the tab that says \"Making Home Affordable.\" And here's the big picture, the plan has two initiatives. The first is for people underwater in their mortgage. Who qualifies? Well, if you are current, but can't refinance because of falling home prices, you could be in line for some help. The loan must be held by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Ask your lender. Now, what it does for you is it allows you to refinance into a loan with lower monthly payments or avoid a big fat rate reset. There's no principle reduction but you could save money over the life of your loan. Now, the second imitative is designed to help lower monthly payments for homeowners at risk of foreclosure. These loan modifications work by reducing interest rates. The new interest rate is in place for five years, after that it resets higher each and every year for five years. This program also includes a new provision that would eliminate borrower's second mortgages. Now, you qualify, if you're behind on mortgage payments. The mortgage must be for your primary home, it can't be an investment. The monthly mortgage bill must be more than 31 percent of your monthly gross income. To get ready, here's what you'll need: Put together the proof of your income, these are your W-2s, your most recent income tax return, second mortgage documents if you have it, credit card payment proof. This is critical and information on other loans including student loans, car loans, whatever you got. Now, whether or not you can afford your house is critical to your financial health, but so is your job, if you're lucky to have one these days. If you don't, or you're looking to trade up to a better job, you'll want to listen up. Jennifer Merritt is the career editor for the \"Wall Street Journal\" and Manisha Thakor is a personal finance expert and auditor of \"On My Own Two Feet.\" Great to see both of you guys. You know, there's a lot of conversation about the best places to go for jobs. And I think all of us have had the experience of sending out resumes to a million different places and nothing happens. That seems to be the old fashioned way to do it. Manisha, what's the new way to do it?",
    "statement": "The new way is to remember that your time is money. And I <THINK> people need to be really strategic. I suggest going to trade organizations or reading blogs and writing to people who are talking specifically about the area of your interest. You do not have time to send out 100 resumes to somebody who's receiving 100 resumes."

    "statement": "Well, the longer they hang on, the more likely it is that transmission - if that tick happens to be infected - will transmit the organism, the bacteria, to us. And so there's much to be said that if you've been out and about, check yourself when you come back in and have somebody else check the back of your hair and, as Dr. Mather says, your backsides also, because you can't really twist <AROUND> and see that very well."

As you mentioned, the Nasdaq is down in bear market territory for the year to date, down 21 percent, and since that March high of 5048, off 36 1/2 percent. There is definitely a gloom and doom hanging onto the Nasdaq, which is clearly apparent from the volume to say the least. Now Friday was expected to be light volume, it was the lightest day of the year, because of the Memorial Day holiday, but besides the holiday weekend, we've seen consistent days of 1-1.5 billion shares, which folk, these days. is light volume, considering we got up to 2.8 billion shares on the heaviest trading day so far this year. Basically, the folks that I talk to say that there are a couple of reasons for this doom and gloom. First of all, lots of individual and institutional investors have simply gotten burned on the big Nasdaq stocks, not even the fly-by-night ones that had been sketchy from the beginning with lack of revenues. We're talking about Cisco, off 33 percent from its 52-week high, 37 percent; Microsoft down 49 percent; The chip stocks, Rambus a good example; Amazon.com, we've heard about their woes; and Qualcomm, the high-flier of 1999, up 2600 percent, let's remember that, up 2600, so 67 percent down isn't so terrible by comparison, but nonetheless, folks who have been used to scoring gains repeatedly in these high-tech stocks and the more heavyweight names are really getting hurt. Add to that, how much will the Fed tightening hurt the new economy? Nobody knows, and it is simply just not clear yet; add to that the fear about the ability of e-tailers to actually stay afloat. Remember, the bankruptcy of Europe's first major Internet retailer Boo.com? Well. that certainly scared a lot of investors out there, especially following that \"Barron's\" article awhile ago talking about how cash reserves are drying up at these e-tailers. So the idea here is that the fairy tale may be over for the tech stocks, at least short-term, and everybody is skittish about making any big commitments.

Congress can impose whatever rules it wants for congressional elections. If the states want to have different rules for their local elections, they can, but most of them would go along. This is how we had laws like the 1993 Motor Voter Law, which required the states to do certain voter registration activities, keep their voter rolls clean. We had the Help America Vote Act in 2002. Congress can do this. I don't think they're going to do it, but we could have Congress step in tomorrow and set up a national agency that would run our elections.",

They voted that way in 2001, 2003, again several times this last year. The Republicans are on record, all of them, that all of these tax cuts <SHOULD> be extended -- this is Obama's pound of flesh because he won the presidential election. He's the one insisting that taxes go up. They're going to <TAKE> $500 billion out of savings in the United States over the next decade and give it to the federal government. This is not helpful to the economy, and it will hurt the economy. But remember Obama is not just raising taxes on the rich right now. We're <ABOUT> to enter a decade where a trillion-dollars is going to be taken away from the American people in higher taxes to pay for Obamacare. This was passed only by Democrats. It is entirely a Democrat tax increase. And it includes many taxes that directly hit middle income and lower income people. So Obama's tax increase is not just the top tax rates. It's people -- if you have bad health problems and you spend more than 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income on out-of- pocket health costs, you used to be able to deduct anything above that. Thanks to Obama's law, Obamacare, that's now 10 percent. So $2 million to $3 million will be taken out of people average income $53,000 a year, who are lower income, middle income and sick. They're going to be paying taxes for Obamacare. There's an avalanche of Obama tax increases coming next year."

Today, their effort to convince Niger to return Saadi Gadhafi failed. A government spokesman said Niger believes Gadhafi's son would have no chance of receiving a fair trial and could face the death penalty. Saadi fled to Niger last weekend, along with other top Gadhafi loyalists. Now, Libyan fighters could find Moammar Gadhafi hiding out in one of his last remaining strongholds. Then again, maybe not. If history's any guide, it can sometimes take years to hunt down the world's most wanted fugitives. The hunt for Osama bin Laden kicked off into high gear after the 9/11 attacks, but it wasn't until this May, nearly ten years later, that the US finally caught up with the al Qaeda leader, killing him in that deadly raid on his compound in Pakistan. A US-led coalition ousted Iraqi president Saddam Hussein in 2003, but it was more than eight months before the bedraggled former dictator was finally found hiding in a spider hole. Hussein was eventually tried and hanged. The so-called Butcher of Bosnia, Radovan Karadzic, was indicted for war crimes in 1995. He went on the run, changing his appearance, grew a long beard, and then wasn't captured until 2008, 13 years later. Karadzic is now on trial at the Hague. We've heard speculation come and go about where Moammar Gadhafi might be. Are Libyan fighters even close, though, to capturing him? Let's bring in Saad Djebbar, he is a former legal adviser to Gadhafi's government. You can offer us some insight, hopefully. I mean, where do you think Gadhafi would have gone as a -- as a natural response when all of this started happening?",

Mr. Strange wasn't the president's hand-picked candidate. But look, the Trump agenda really is what won here.

    "previous_statement": "The NFL preseason kicked off in full force last night, and with it a new round of protests during the national anthem. There were players who took a knee, others who would raise their fists, or sat out the anthem all together in the locker room. Joining us now to discuss that and more, CNN contributor, national reporter for \"The Washington Post,\" Wes Lowery, and Georgetown Professor Michael Eric Dyson. His new book, \"What Truth Sounds Like,\" is a \"New York Times\" instant bestseller. Gentlemen, thanks so much for being with us. I have to say, we invited you here because this is the one year anniversary of the white supremacist rallies in Charlottesville. There's a whole lot to discuss tonight. These protests came out overnight. We're waiting for the president to respond. Professor, you know, what did you see last night? What is the fact that these players continue to make this statement? What does it tell you?",
    "statement": "Well, first of all, black life continue to matter to them and doesn't <SEEM> to matter to others who continue to victimize black people with random violence and arbitrary forms of aggression. Number two, these are grown black men. They will not be dictated to and told by the president of the United States of America or a football league, a sports league, about what it means to be a responsible, conscientious citizen. Here we are talking about the one year anniversary of white supremacists and nationalists and neo-Nazis expressing their right to protest in America, and yet these black men of valor, of integrity, of courage and bravery are being muffled. And finally what it says to us is that all players <SHOULD> have a conscience <AROUND> this, not just black players. Where is Aaron Rodgers in this whole situation. He praised LeBron James for keeping his comportment in the face of assault by the president, but where is this pro-active engagement with these players to link arms, even if he doesn't raise a fist, raise a voice and say something important. That's what I <THINK> these protests suggest."

So that's the argument that will be made. The stronger argument, though, in the end that they'll make is that that statement is a vague statement. You notice he doesn't say I killed Berman.

But he backed the White House into an alternative solution to this, and though the administration's story today is that this has been on the table for some time, Kerry testified earlier before the House Armed Services Committee, along with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey.

    "previous_statement": "I mean sometimes I wonder whether you view -- I mean I speak to you as not just a former Irish prime minister, but also as a former leader in the E.U. You are speaking on behalf, or the same kind of sentiments that the rest of the E.U. would be saying. They are saying, because the Brexiteers keep saying that, oh, the E.U. will definitely need to compromise because they don't want a no deal even worse than we don't want a no deal. But we've seen a lot of reporting, and I wonder if you can confirm, that the E.U. have actually -- now they're pretty fed up, they kind of have backed it in that Britain will leave. They think that even if there is another referendum, there will be a sort of, you know, a rump Brexit, you know, sort of troublemakers for a long time within the E.U., if Britain does stay. Their businesses are ramping up and have been working for the last three years to, you know, to prepare themselves for this. I guess what I'm trying to ask is, is it -- who's it going to be worse for, this game of chicken? Who's going to suffer the most?",
    "statement": "Well, I <THINK> there have been economic studies that have been done that if a hard Brexit or a no-deal Brexit comes into effect, the biggest loser by a substantial distance will be Britain. Ireland will be the second biggest loser, and it will suffer substantial losses, and we've been making provision for that in the budgets we had this week. And then after that, a number of other European countries, Belgium and The Netherlands and France I think will suffer a little. But most of the European Union 27 countries will not be particularly affected by the departure of Britain. And there is, I think, as you're suggesting, a lot of impatience in the European Union with all the time that's being taken up with Brexit, when we have so many other problems to face in the European Union, the completion of the single currency, dealing with the refugee crisis. And your earlier interviewee highlighted the possibility of another flood of refugees coming into the European Union as a result of the actions being taken by Turkey. These are all issues that the European Union needs to get on with, and it is being distracted by the continuing indecision in Westminster, its indecision in Westminster, a government with a majority in Westminster, made a deal, and it couldn't get it through. Now, a prime minister without a majority is coming forward with a new proposal, and there are questions being asked in Brussels. <COULD> he get any deal that we <MIGHT> get through parliament either? And that question -- there's no obvious answer to that question."

In a vote that just happened, it was 57 to 42, meaning they fell three votes shy of the 60 that they needed to break a filibuster and move forward on this effort.

That is a big deal for those children and missing the school and the learning for the families for countless people. You held a hearing today with the Education Secretary Betsy Devos, you brought up this issue. What do you think needs to happen? Obviously, you want to be on the side of safety, but when you're keeping millions of children out of school who are not sick, is that the right thing to do? I mean, what's the right thing to do here?",
    "statement": "These are the decisions every school district is struggling to make the correct decision. One school district that I <KNOW> of in the Seattle area, 30,000 plus kids is now telling them to stay home for several weeks. Their absentee rate was at 20 percent. They have a high number of employees who are over 60. Public health is telling you if you're over 60, that this virus can have a serious impact. So stay home so they had school employees now coming home. They're working really hard to try and make <SURE> the kids are getting an education. But I will tell you parents who don't have paid sick leave are now having to stay home with their kids or kids are staying home alone or they're staying with grandparents who are at that age of the highest impact or they're hanging out in the mall. So these are really difficult decisions for school districts to make. I can tell you from on the ground in Washington State, everyone is trying to do the <BEST> that they can. But what this means is we need policies in place in this country that are there for us when we have these kinds of public health emergencies."

And you are mentioning some of these details that are very disturbing details coming out about the gunman. \"The New York Times\" report that he was apparently having a dinner party watching mass shooting videos the night before this incident. And, also, we are hearing from a report by the SITE intelligence group, that's a nongovernmental organization. SITE stands for Search for International Terrorists Entities, their report talks about his social media presence. They say that he quoted Osama bin Laden in a will to Twitter, that he espoused anti-American views and expressed hatred toward Americans for what he perceived to be a pro-Israeli stance. Now, these are bits and pieces we are starting to learn about him. One of our producers spoke to some members of the Muslim community here in Pensacola yesterday to see if anyone had known him or seen him worship at their mosques. And what he found was that there was only maybe one person who had run into al-Shamrani outside of Walmart but that conversation was not very extended.

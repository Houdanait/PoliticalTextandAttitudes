And by pulling out of the JCPOA, I think we've done just that. Everybody, all of our allies, everyone that was a partner to the agreement agrees that Iran had not violated anything in the JCPOA. So that should -- and its sole focus and purpose was to prevent them from having a nuclear weapon. What we should have been doing and should have done then to now to come up with another agreement to confront Iran on some of its other aggressions not dealing with the JCPOA. But by just pulling out, leaving our allies on their own causing the kind of unrest that we're seeing starting to take place now in the Middle East, I'm hopeful that we can get back to the table.

CNN's Farai Sevenzo is in Nairobi and joins me now with more. So the role is an advisory role. Obviously, we're not talking about combat at all here. What is the expectation on what the U.S. troops will be doing?",
    "statement": "<WELL>, what we <KNOW>, Hala, is that <ABOUT> 40, the number we have from the U.S. African command, is that 40 troops of 101st Airborne Division will be in Somalia to lend logistical support, which is logistical support that has been asked for by the Somali government. The Somali National Army <WOULD> like this <<KIND OF>> support. And the U.S. article command is keen and very at pace to tell us that this is not <ABOUT> special troops fighting. This is not <ABOUT> engaging in drone strikes. This is <ABOUT> helping the Somali government deal with to al- Shabaab by providing them the <<KIND OF>> logistical support they <NEED TO> set up warehouses, to set up bridges, to fortify the hotels. As you <KNOW>, bombs go off in Mogadishu almost on a weekly, monthly basis we report here. They call it Mogadishu music. The explosions go on because al-Shabaab is determined to hold back this government that's trying to reach for democracy. And, of course, speaking to you here for Kenya, you <KNOW> that two weeks ago, it was the anniversary of the University of Garissa. One hundred forty-eight students were killed there. Sixty-eight people were killed in Westgate. Al-Shabaab is a very real threat in this area, and this <<KIND OF>> support is sorely needed, not just for the Somalis, but for the Kenyans and the African forces that you mentioned."

Iran is mostly a Shia Muslim nation but it's having problems with some of its Sunnis. The Sunnis say as a minority, their rights are being trampled. Some have turned to violence. So, what does the Iranian government do? Tehran sends a delegation of top military commanders to the town in the midst of the trouble, Sarbaz, to try to reassure the Sunnis that everything's fine. And then what happens? <WELL>, here's what happens. A purported Sunni militant detonates a bomb leaving 42 people dead including five senior commanders of the government's revolutionary guard.

I'm going to read you some quotes from Mohammad Ali Jafari, the revolutionary guard's number one. Today he's saying that this deadly attacked was planned in order to fraud quote \"New evidence has been obtained proving the link between yesterday's terrorist attack and the U.S British and Pakistani intelligence services.\" And then the general says this, \"There will <HAVE TO> be retaliatory measures to punish them.\" A <CERTAIN> level of bluster, <WELL>, <<PROBABLY>> so.

You <KNOW>, we had heard allegations <ABOUT> this fraud during the campaign, but I had no idea how deep and how wide it went, and that it went <ALL> the way to the very top of my opponent's campaign. We saw the cover-ups of evidence that was not being submitted to the board under subpoena. We saw leaked early voting information from the local Board of Elections to their campaign. But more than anything, we saw actual systematic criminal activity where my opponent's campaign hired people to go to voters' houses and <TAKE> their ballots, <SOMETIMES> fill in choices for other candidates. It appears they threw ballots in the trash. There's nothing more sacred in our country than your right to vote. It's something that so many men and women have fought overseas and <GIVEN> their lives for.

And that's -- that's an <ESSENTIAL> point here."

Even senators have a <<SENSE>> of humor <ABOUT> these things. I want to show you a photo. Republican Senator Thom Tillis -- here comes the President right now. We'll watch the President's motorcade arrive here on Capitol Hill. If there's any way to split the screen, I <WOULD> like to also show you Thom Tillis as we wait for the motorcade to dome in these are long motorcades, welcome to Washington, D.C. Thom Tillis, Republican senator of North Carolina <ABOUT> to head up to this meeting filling up a bag of popcorn. Asking if he's bringing the popcorn up for the Corker/Trump fight? He said, yes. You're waiting on anticipation of these photos control and you're going to wait a long time. Presidential motorcades in Washington, D.C., go a long way here. The President arriving on Capitol Hill, let's talk. I <<GUESS>> we're fascinated to show the D.C. police department and their great equipment. There's the President's motorcade coming into the White House right now. We're making light of this because of the personal feud but, again, we are <ABOUT> 10 months into the Trump presidency. They have zero big legislative wins. So our Jeff Zeleny saying the President wants to press them to move more quickly to confirm his nominee so we're still waiting. Now, the President is late to nominate a lot of these people and the Democrats have taken every advantage they can to then slow the pace down when it gets up there. So the President will push not just for tax reform, <<PERHAPS>> suggesting the Senate stay in on the weekends. Jeff Zeleny is reporting to get some of the nominees through before the end of the year. So kicking the can <A BIT> there. But the big <QUESTION> here is a, the tax reform, b, what the subset of the relationship. Because the relationship was not where it needed to be to get Obamacare done. The <QUESTION> is can they get there? The President is going to be in this room. He is fighting today with Bob Corker. He's been fighting in recent days and this one goes back a while. It has a history with Senator John McCain. There are others like <MODERATE> Susan Collins, more <MODERATE> Lisa Murkowski who disagreed with the President not just on the substance of Obamacare but on how he went <ABOUT> the debate. You've had Ben Sasse, the senator from Nebraska tweeting that the President misbehaves too <OFTEN>, doesn't speak in a way that he finds to be, shall we say, civic minded? It only takes two Republicans to <TAKE> the train off the tracks because they have a 52/48 majority.

Joe Biden is selling Joe Biden the human being, someone you know, someone you like, someone who is compassionate, someone who in his heart, as he said in his video announcement of his campaign, is offended by Trump and by what happened in Charlottesville. I think this is really about a personal appeal. And it is also about the electability, about positioning him as a moderate, about signaling to voters that he's the candidate who is not looking for a political revolution, who is not looking to disrupt the whole system, but who wants to take the successes of the Obama administration, as Democratic voters see them, and protect them.",

The United States is presenting a clear choice to every nation, stand with the civilized world or stand with the terrorists. And for those nations that stand with the terrorists, there will be a heavy price. America is determined to oppose the state's sponsor of terror. Yet, we are equally determined to respect and help the men and women, those regimes oppressed. Our enemy is not the Arab world. Many friendly Arab governments are themselves the targets of extremist terror. Our enemy is not Islam, a good and peace-loving faith that brings direction and comfort to over one billion people, including millions of Americans. And our enemy is not the people of any nation even when their leaders harbor terrorists. Our enemy is the terrorists themselves and the regimes that shelter and sustain them. Afghanistan is the case-in-point. Its Taliban regime has made that nation into a sanctuary and training ground for international terrorists, terrorists, who have killed innocent citizens of many nations, including our own. The Taliban promotes terror abroad and practices terror against its people, oppressing women and persecuting all who dissent. The Taliban has been given the opportunity to surrender all the terrorist in Afghanistan and to close down their camps and operations. Full warning has been given and time is running out. The Afghan people, however, are the victims of oppression, feminine and misrule. Many refugees from that unfortunate are on the move and sadly, many Afghans are on the verge of starvation. American respects the Afghan people, their long tradition and their proud independence and we will help in this time of confusion and crisis in their country. American has long been the largest source of food and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. This week, I announced an additional $320 million in aid to the Afghan people, to those within Afghanistan and those who fled across borders. Despite efforts by the Taliban to disrupt these critical aid shipments, we will deliver food and seeds, vaccines and medicine by truck and even by draft animals. Conditions permitting, we will bring help directly to the people of Afghanistan by airdrops. This aid will help Afghans make it through the upcoming winter. For the longer term, I urge Congress to make funds available so that one day, the United States can contribute, along with other friends of Afghanistan to the reconstruction and development of that troubled nation. Helping people in great need is a central part of the Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions, as well as many other faiths. It is also a central part of the American tradition. Even as we fight evil regimes, we are generous to the people they oppress. Following World War II, America fed and rebuilt Japan and Germany and their people became some of our closest friends in the world. In the struggle ahead, we will act in accordance with American ideals. We are offering help and friendship to the Afghan people. It is their Taliban rulers and the terrorists they harbor who have much to fear. Thank you for listening.",

On the military front, the president saying and quoting now - \"full warning has been given. Time is running out.\" Relative to the humanitarian situation, the president, again, referring that food drops are a strong possibility to the Afghan people, again, a reference to Japan and Germany during the Second World War. Back to Kelly Wallace near Camp David. And Kelly, it is remarkable and in almost every speech that we hear, this address is always brought up - our fight, our war is not against Islam, it is not against the Arab people.

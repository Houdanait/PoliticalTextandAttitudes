A White House -- again, just to remind everyone -- funded by taxpayers dollars, where you have now the president making a number of disparaging and just untrue statements, including calling former Vice President Joe Biden, quote, \"stupid\" along with a slew of other lies. And by the way, Mr. President, it is Kamala -- Kalama Harris. Gloria Borger, Abby Phillip, Dr. Kent Sepkowitz are all with me. And I just want to run through a couple, because we just know we have to fact-check when we listen to the president live. Before we get to his vociferous -- again -- denial of the \"Atlantic\" piece, I just want to say, he continues to bring up that you know, Obama and Biden spied on his campaign, always going back to Obama, you know, trying to relitigate 2016. This is just the facts, so we're all on the same page. The FBI opened an investigation, utilized routine surveillance methods to find out what was going on. Along the way, the FBI made some serious mistakes, but there is no evidence that either Biden or Obama were ever personally involved in doing something like that. So that said, Gloria, I want to start with you on this -- the \"Atlantic\" piece, where you know, the article came out -- I believe it was last Thursday evening, you know, alleging that Trump referred to fallen soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers,\" and that was just a piece of everything else that was alleged in this article, which by the way has been corroborated by us at CNN and \"New York Times\" and even \"Fox News\" and the \"A.P.\" and \"The Washington Post.\" But to hear his say -- and let me pull this verbatim up from Barbara Starr, this is what the president said. \"I'm not saying the military's in love with me. The soldiers are. The top people in the Pentagon probably aren't because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else, stay happy.\"",

But then he <SORT OF> went on to talk <ABOUT> John McCain in the same way the article said that he talked <ABOUT> John McCain, as if he <SHOULD> get credit for not ruining John McCain's funeral. And so he brought the story <KIND OF> to life again. And today, I don't <KNOW> if my colleagues would agree with me, but he seemed to be in really a foul mood today. I don't <KNOW> if you got that sense. He was full of grievance and vitriol, and also throwing charges out there. For example, Brooke and Abby, this is -- Abby <KNOWS> more <ABOUT> this than anyone here -- that there are 80 million ballots all over the country that are being sent to people that have been unrequested as part of his talking points <ABOUT> how this is a rigged election --"

The few remaining doctors in Aleppo, they sent a letter begging President Obama to step in and stop the horrific bombings in the rebel held city. This letter comes a suspected chlorine gas attack killed at least 3 people and injured dozens more including two dozen children. In this open letter to the President these doctors write in part, quote, \"We do not need tears or sympathy or even prayers. We desperately need a zone free of the bombing over Eastern Aleppo to stop the attacks, and international action to ensure Aleppo is never besieged again.\" CNN's Clarissa Ward was inside rebel held Aleppo just a couple of months ago and joins me now from London. So wonderful always to talk to you, Clarissa, and let me just begin with over the course of years you have talked to a number of doctors like these. Clearly the frustration is there, talk to me about the White House response to this letter.",

And essentially reiterating their call for all sides to head to the negotiating table saying there can be no solution but a diplomatic solution or a political solution essentially. We already heard from one of the doctors that wrote the letter responding to that saying he is shocked and disappointed. The situation is dire in Eastern Aleppo, Brooke, you have 300,000 civilians entrapped there. Just 15 doctors caring for them. A lack of basic electricity, water, food, medicine. They don't have CT scanners, they don't life support machines, they don't have enough oxygen to give infants and babies and incubators, they don't even have diesel which they need to power generators. So we are really looking at humanitarian crisis here and I <THINK> while the doctors did not necessarily expect President Obama to change course on Syria, there is growing frustration that the international community is leaving these people to die, Brooke."

    "previous_statement": "Interesting. All right, Dave, thanks for that. The Las Vegas shooting likely to make hotels and other properties on the Vegas strip rethink their security measures. Experts who spoke to CNN say there's little that can be done to prevent a kind of massacre we saw this week. CNN Scott McLean spoke with security experts in Las Vegas. He's live McCarran Airport, monitoring the travel of course of Marilou Danley, the girlfriend of the killer who has just returned from Asia. So what are they saying? I mean this guy got all those weapons, cameras into that hotel suite, a place that's already heavily, heavily monitored. I mean could they have prevented this? I mean what would they change in terms of security?",
    "statement": "<SURE>. So, Christine, the sheriff here in Las Vegas says he can't see any way for something like this to have been prevented. We also spoke to an expert, as you said, a guy with more than 20 years of experience at the FBI, seven years of experience heading up the security detail for the Venetian hotel, a big large hotel resort complex here in Las Vegas and he agrees. This <MAY> not have been preventable. Stephen Paddock, he did not have a criminal record. He didn't have any mental health issues that anyone was aware of. He was able to purchase all of his guns legally, and nothing that he did likely would have raised red flags for this hotel. <SURE>, there are security cameras all throughout. Hotels are very common in Las Vegas, but the people who monitor them, they're looking for things that are out of the ordinary. Bringing up bag up to a room, it's not so out of the ordinary. But what <ABOUT> the number of bags? <WELL>, the security expert says look, some people traveled internationally, their moving, they often have a lot of bags. It's not that uncommon. But the staff, they went inside the room before, they said they didn't see anything amiss. I asked here a security expert <ABOUT> that. Listen."

To your exact point, it takes time to get it out and get it going to scale, so that's important to realize. I mean, Dr. Schaffner, what do you make about the doctor that Erica spoke to in her piece? And he said, we just don't know if this is a category five storm and we are in the outer bands, as opposed to whether we're right by the eye or close to it and as bad as it gets. Would you agree with that analogy at this point?",

But instead of a good natured using or two, many used the opportunity to call out Cosby for a series of sexual assault allegations against him, 14 allegations, to be precise, all of which he has denied. Still, the stunts led the captions such as this one, quote, \"that <<FEELING>> you get from being America's most beloved serial rapist.\" <CERTAINLY> not what the Cosby team had in mind. The allegations against Cosby first emerged in 2004. He was never convicted, but Cosby did settle a civil lawsuit with one of his accusers. The scandal seemed to be behind him.

We need to push this responsibility to the states. There's a number of states that have central security teams that are highly competent. Colorado is probably the best example that I personally worked with. Every state needs to have a cyber-security center on elections who can support then all of the cities and counties. There's over 10,000 local election authorities. We can't have 10,000 competent security teams, but we can have 50. And so we -- we need to have federal legislation to support that, to give them access to intelligence to do clearances for the people, because they're going to need access to NSA and FBI data, but we've got to push that responsibility to the states.

He faces 15 charges, including rape and sexual assault against six sisters, six children, six out of ten youngsters who were living in his Pennsylvania home, 10 little girls, all sisters, living in his home. He`s charged with raping six of them. That`s what they were, children. Apparently, he lived with them for years. One of the girls actually had two babies fathered by Lee Kaplan. We are still trying to get our heads around what the parents of these 10 girls understood about him, what they knew about him, why they allowed their 10 girls to live with this man. Apparently, they made arrangements for Kaplan to have their girls. Court documents reveal some of the details. You`re going to have to bear with me. This is not pleasant. Victim number one was 12 years old the first time Lee Kaplan had vaginal intercourse with her. Another victim said she was 14. Kaplan took her as his wife and then, quote, \"consummation was accomplished by Kaplan penetrating her front hole, as she said, with his private part.\" Another victim said, according to the probable cause affidavit, quote, \"When she was 10, 10 years old,\" Lee Kaplan had, quote, \"sex with her for the first time. She says he put his penis in her birth hole,\" end quote. In all, 12 girls were found living with Kaplan. That`s a dozen possible victims, 12 girls. Prosecutors say Kaplan made the girls believe that he was some kind of religious figure. The sisters are from Amish country and religion is a big part of daily life there. And here these young girls are thrust into the arms of what some would agree, most would agree, I think almost everyone might agree is the devil if he`s, in fact, guilty of these crimes. This is such a complicated chart, I had to show you this, that the district attorney used it. Don`t bother reading it. I`m going to get it all to you in a moment. I just want to you see what this looks like, what the commonwealth actually released in order to try make the flow chart make sense for us. It`s a lot of victims to comprehend there, six boxes with a bunch of ugly uglies all inside. But those six boxes, those six girls -- they`re not potentially the only potential victims here. Matthew Weintraub is the Bucks County district attorney. He`s with me live. Mr. District attorney, I don`t even know where to begin. I don`t know where you begin.

    "previous_statement": "Absolutely. Let's move in here and take a little bit of time and look at exactly what's been going on here. When you look at the state of Texas, it's a very, very big place of course. I'm going to remember some of my Texas geography as best I can her. Ft. Hood is going to be right down in about the more or less the middle of the state. And I say the middle of the state, it's a big state, so there's a lot of middle there. So an hour north of Austin, let's say, maybe two or three hours south of Dallas. These aren't straight lines, but generally into that area. I'm going to turn off all these different labels I have here for a minute so we can just move in and show you the base. It's a big sprawling facility here, about 340 or so square miles of facility. It was once a variety of different bases. They were joined together over many years and became Ft. Hood which is a massive, massive military installation with a tremendous number of people there. Let's go in because this is the area we're talking about right here and it really is in the heart of base. In the big picture here, you can see the cluster of the main part of the base there, it sort of stands out in this form. But as we move a little bit closer, I'm going take you right into the readiness center, which is the part that we're most interested in. This is where we believe that all the trouble took place. And it is centrally located on this base. Just a short distance away, you can see these are the headquarters of the first cavalry, the renowned first cavalry. They've been tremendously respected throughout the military and certainly in the Army circles in a very, very big way. This is where it all appears to have happened. What do we know about this facility? We know that the authorities say that there was one gunman that we know about that had two pistols that we've been told about. We don't know if there was anything else involved. Two other suspects have been picked up. We don't know if they were involved. They're simply suspects at this point but add it up, we have about 117,000 square feet, 40,000 troops in the area, we have 17,000 family members on post. This is a tremendous number of folks, more than 1,000 cars could fit into the area around here n all this has been cause for tremendous concern in that community. We'll be back in just a minute with more as we keep adding up the facts in this case getting more into what we really do know about this rampage on this military base which has certainly shaken the whole military community and the rest of the country this afternoon. Stay with us.",

Two others are believed to be <SUSPECTS> and they are still -- they are being questioned presumably right now by law enforcement. Heather McGarity is on the phone with us right now.

I do <THINK> that we have to look at the overall difficulty and complexity of trying to help a society recover from the <KIND OF> tyranny that Saddam Hussein imposed on it. This was never going to be easy. It was always going to have ups and downs. I'm <SURE> that we have made many decisions, some of which were good, some of which <MIGHT> not have been good, but the strategic decision to overthrow Saddam Hussein was the right one. And we're all going to be very glad that we no longer have to deal with a bloody dictator in the middle of the world's most dangerous region who was an avowed enemy of the United States. I would rather trade the considerable difficulty of helping the Iraqi people get to a democratic future and a future in which they will be allies in the war on terror for what was yet again a chance or a policy that <THOUGHT> that we <COULD> buy stability even if there was a regime of the tremendous brutality of Saddam Hussein's in place in the Middle East. So I <THINK> we made the right decision to overthrow him. Having made that strategic decision, you're right. We do have some big tactical challenges to get to the strategic goal that we have. After the election -- and I do <THINK> the election is an important event. It's a next step on the Iraqi people's road to a better future. It is not the final step. It's a step that will allow them to elect leaders who will then begin the political process of trying to deal with the many divisions, historic and other divisions, that the Iraqi people themselves have. And they're going to have to make political compromises to do it. They're going to have to find their own way politically and we will be there to support them. That is, <PERHAPS>, the most important set of steps that have to take place after this election. Our role, as you rightly say, is to focus on what we can do to help them build capacity in their security forces and in their economy. And in their security forces, again, I -- we can talk <ABOUT> what was foreseeable or what was not. The people who are fighting now -- yes, some of them are frustrated young people and we need to do, and Prime Minister Allawi is doing what he can to siphon those people off and to give them a stake in the future of Iraq. And he's doing it. We will help him with jobs programs. I <THINK> we do, as one adjustment, need to pay more attention to what jobs we are creating for Iraqis out of the reconstruction dollars that we are spending. And that's one issue that I've asked to have looked at a little bit more closely, if the metric is how many jobs are we creating, how are we really creating jobs for the Iraqis. But many of the people who are blowing up their fellow citizens, are blowing up Iraqis, are not actually people who were angry because they weren't paid. They are people who were part of Saddam Hussein's regime. They were Baathists at the high level of Baathism, not people who joined the party because they had to to get a job, but people who enjoyed the benefits and the fruits of Saddam Hussein's regime and people who spent their lives oppressing their fellow citizens. They've lost power and they want it back. And so we have to be <CLEAR> who the enemy is here. Others are foreign terrorists, like Zarqawi, the face of terrorism, who frankly do see Iraq as the central front in the war on terror. And they were committing terrorist acts some place. They weren't sitting and drinking tea some place. They were fighters, hard-core fighters in the war on terrorism. Now they've decided to fight in Iraq."

That's what's so remarkable about this pope.",
    "statement": "We didn't expect him to enter into the Syria conflict like he did. Remember, he penned a letter to Putin when the G-20 was meeting in Russia. He said no military intervention. Dial this down. Then he not only did that, but he said to the people, you cannot have military intervention and continue to kill people in the name of any <KIND OF> justice. And so, then he had a day of prayer and fast fasting for an end to the conflict in Syria. That's when everything began to be dialed down. So, some said the prayer helped. The pope was instrumental in Syria laying down those arms for awhile."

The only thing I really miss about      doing it these days is that there's maybe a few people in every crowd      that haven't heard it, but it's nothing like having the few hundred or a      few thousand people years and years ago--40 years ago--when nobody had      heard it.  Those moments can't be repeated. And not only that, there were      people singing this song together who politically had nothing in common      and probably wouldn't have talked to each other.  But to see them all      singing together reminded me of the spirit of what the country was all      about, and I was thrilled.  And, unfortunately, those days are gone for      me.

    "previous_statement": "Gary Locke really found himself as the man in the middle here. He is the ambassador. He helped harbor Chen Guangcheng when he escaped from house arrest. He was also there every step of the way when Chen left the embassy. You saw them smiling together. You saw them in the car together. You saw Gary Locke taking him to the hospital. But everything changed between leaving the embassy and speaking to us at 3 a.m. on Thursday morning. On that day, Chen had changed his mind. He didn't want to leave the embassy. He didn't want to stay in China. He wanted to go to the United States. He was then pointing the finger back at the U.S. in saying they did not treat him properly. We put those questions to Gary Locke as well and he said, as far as he was concerned they did do the right thing by Chen. It was always Chen's idea to stay in China. He said Chen wanted to be a freedom fighter for his own country and be reunited with his family and live out his life here. This is what we had to hear from Chen Guangcheng when we finally got hold of him at 3:00 in the morning.",
    "statement": "It's an a small voice on the end of a phone line, but with an explosive story to tell. At 3 a.m. Thursday in Beijing and Chen Guangchang answer our call. From his hospital bed, the blind dissident the world wants to hear from, now tells CNN he fears for his life. He says he wants to get out of China and is appealing to President Obama himself. I would like to say to him, please do everything you can to get our whole family out. He pleads. He wants to go to the United States. A country that hours earlier drove him to a Chinese hospital and he says left him there. Chen had been holed up for six days in the U.S. embassy. He fled refuge there. After fleeing 18 months of what he called brutal house arrest. After back room negotiations, the U.S. and China seemed to have reached a deal. Chen <COULD> live freely and safely. A smiling Chen Guangcheng is seen here leaving the embassy for treatment at the hospital. But between leaving the U.S. grounds and speaking to us, everything changed. I'm very disappointed with the U.S. government he says. Chen now claims he was urged to leave and then deserted. The embassy kept lobbying me to leave he said and promised to be with me at the hospital. But this afternoon soon after we got here, they were all gone. Inside the embassy walls, Chen says, he was cut off from the outside world. Now doesn't <THINK> he knew enough to make such a critical decision. At the time, I didn't have a lot of information, he says, I wasn't allowed to call my friends from inside the embassy. I couldn't keep up with the news so I didn't <KNOW> a lot of what was happening. What was happening, he now says, is his family in their village was being terrorized. After discovering Chen escaped, police turned on his wife. She was tied to a chair by police for two days, he tells us. They carried thick sticks to our house threatening to beat her to death. If he didn't leave the embassy, Chen said, his wife was told she would pay the price. They said they would send her back to Shandong and beat her to death he says. Each time CNN has tried to independently confirm these claims, we have been physically ejected from Chen's village by guys. This day, Chen passed the phone to his wife. Like her husband, she says there is no future for them here."

    "previous_statement": "Not surprisingly, the column has drawn sharp attacks from some Obamacare defenders when insists that Sundby has lost coverage, she should do better to blame big business than big government. United announced it was pulling out of the individual insurance market in California months ago and adds it was not because of Obamacare rather the company had only about 8,000 patients under such plans, and had seen no growth on that front in years. What's more, some analysts believed the insurance industry on the whole has long tried to get away from the sickest, most costly patients and Obamacare actually makes it possible for those patients with pre-existing conditions to be insured even if they are dropped. Still on the idea that Sundby cannot keep the specific care she has relied upon, she appears to be on firm ground. Under United Healthcare, she had ready access to cancer specialist at both Stanford and the University of California at San Diego. And now she'll have to choose between one or the other. It is not clear that any option available under Obamacare will allow her to keep the doctors that she has counted on in both of those places -- Erin.",

I <KNOW> that's miraculous thing given what you've endured. You <KNOW>, you write <ABOUT> in this op-ed how you're losing coverage from an insurer that I'm quoting you never once questioned a treatment or a procedure recommended by your medical team to the cost of <ABOUT> $1.2 million. And you say that to get the equivalent coverage that you have you'd have to go outside the Obamacare exchanges and pay 40 percent to 50 percent more. Just on a practical level, <COULD> you even afford that?"

And if you look at that sort of parallel peace process that they're trying to jump start, the Astana Process, certainly the Iranians play an important role in that, and I think that, you know, the Iranians are still very, very influential on the ground in Syria. And there's no doubt as Matthew just said that the Russians are by far the most influential outside power right now and inside Syria, but the Iranians, they still control a lot of those militias. They themselves still have a lot of manpower on the ground as well. And they certainly also have a very good relationship with a lot of these militias, so they really know how to organize things there on the ground, also when it still comes to fighting, the rebels that are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad. At the same time, I wouldn't necessarily say that it's a relationship of love between these two countries. I do believe that there is a certain degree of distrust between the Russians and the Iranians. And the Iranians themselves, I wouldn't necessarily say that part of the population here is souring to what is going on in Syria, but there is a little bit of criticism as well, when you're putting a country right now that's facing economic difficulties to then be involved in quite an expensive, both in blood and in treasure, campaign in Syria, it's not something that's necessarily going down well with -- going down well with everybody here in this country. So, these two countries still very much big allies, but at the same time, I don think necessarily it is a marriage of love between Russia and Iran.",

I'm also told that although the sheriff, and we had that sound bite on our air, and we had it live a little bit earlier, said that he had reason to believe that this person may strike again within 24 hours, I think is what he said. I'm told that in fact, profilers say that it is more likely that he may strike again within several days, that the 24 hour thing may have been a bit of hyperbole, but they do feel, as confident as profilers can be I'm told, that this is a person who is likely to strike again within several hours. Why? Because, as I said, the body was positioned in a very careful and very specific way that apparently gives very significant clues to investigators. It was, in effect, a calling card I'm told, sort of, I'm here, you have to deal with me, and I may be back. But I'm told that it is unlikely, at least this is what the profilers believe, that he would strike again in the same community, that it is more likely, they believe, that this individual would move on and perhaps strike again somewhere else in Southern California, which is one of the reasons why they have been careful, in that press conference that we heard before, to, in effect, warn everybody with children that this is a person who is clearly dangerous, somebody who reached a threshold and beyond, and somebody that is a very difficult kind of person to deal with, and that is the reason why they believe that this is a serial killer. He may or may not have killed before. It is more likely, I'm told, that this is probably a first time, and if so, that also is very dangerous because it means that once he has now crossed that line, there is really no going back -- Kyra.",

The New Jersey governor coming under fire for vetoing legislation that would ban pig farmers from using crates that limit the mobility of pigs. So, let's turn a little more to the 2016 race. New speculation this morning about a possible White House run for Vice President Joe Biden. This after sources say Biden had a private meeting with Senator Elizabeth Warren. The sit-down might be the biggest indication yet that Biden is hearing from influential Dems before announcing his intentions.",
    "statement": "Good morning, Christi. <WELL>, we're getting these details in from my colleague Jeff Zeleny. He broke this story. And it looks like it's the biggest story of the weekend, <CERTAINLY> on the Democratic side of the 2016 race. We <KNOW> that the meeting was held at Biden's request. The senator came to the naval observatory after the vice president asked her to. It was a two-hour long meeting. The pair discussed economic policy according to a person familiar with the discussion. That person told CNN that the presidential campaign or Biden's future was not a particular focus of the discussion. But, of course, this is significant because Senator Warren has become something of a liberal icon. She has a lot of fans, fans who are encouraging her to make a run for the White House in 2016. Now, she's sitting this race out. But she hasn't endorsed any other candidate. So, we <KNOW> that Biden and his supporters are closely watching this race. They're seeing the appeal of another liberal senator, Bernie Sanders, from Vermont. He's drawing huge crowds and inspiring a lot of enthusiasm. And, of course, they've got to be looking at the numbers, numbers like the ones in our most recent CNN/ORC poll. I <THINK> we can put that up on the screen if we have it. The high unfavorable <VIEWS> of Hillary Clinton, our polls showed that 53 percent of voters have an unfavorable <VIEW> of her versus just 44 percent for the vice president. We also <KNOW>, of course, that her honesty and truth worthiness numbers are taking a hit because of all these questions after those e-mails. Our same polls show that more than half of Democrats want to see Biden get in the race. So, you got to figure these are things that they're looking at and considering."

The guy's been sleep-deprived, like all lawyers in this case, so he didn't make the jurisdictional argument, which as a lawyer you usually do in court. You try to knock it out on jurisdictional grounds before you even get to the merits of the case. So I think he probably wishes he made the argument stronger in court, but then the justices on the Florida Supreme Court started asking about it. So he thought, wait a second, what would the U.S. Supreme Court be most amendable to addressing if indeed this case has to go to the U.S. Supreme Court on an expedited basis. And, as you know, Bobbie, the U.S. Supreme Court loves to toss things out on jurisdictional grounds, if they can and if the case warrants.

That, of course, is why the government went back to code orange, a high risk of terror alert. The president heads into the Oval Office about 30 minutes from now just about everyday, and the first thing he gets is what they call a \"threat matrix.\" It is a summary of what the CIA and other intelligence agencies believe is the threat of terrorist attack. The focus now, as Barbara just noted, is overwhelmingly on any preparations that can deter attacks in the coming Memorial Day weekend. And U.S. officials say one of the reasons they raised security publicly is so that everybody can see it, including the terrorists, and then they listen in to see if the terrorists are talking to each other, making plans.

Now, the last two options would likely require the President to declare a national emergency to trigger the use of those funds.

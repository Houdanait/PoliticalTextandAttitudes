He's been struggling to get rides all day. Are you still in favor of Mr. Modi's move? Yes, he says. The fat cats will suffer. They are hording cash. How long can you survive on half pay, I ask?

    "previous_statement": "Others certainly do. All right. Also this morning, we're learning that the U.S. show of force against North Korea wasn't everything it was cracked up to be. Earlier this month, the White House responded to North Korea missile test by sending what President Trump called an armada to the Korean peninsula. But it turn out those ships were steaming in the opposite direction. So, what was behind the mix-up? For the answer, let's bring in CNN's Alexandra Field. She is live in Tokyo where Vice President Pence addressed U.S. troops this morning. Good morning to you, Alex. What was behind that miscommunication?",
    "statement": "<WELL>, it's coming to light white mike pence is in the region he spoke to the troops today onboard the USS Reagan, talking <ABOUT> the resolve of the United States military when it comes to confronting North Korea. He also cited the U.S. military strikes in Syria and the decision to drop the MOAB, the mother of <ALL> bombs, in Afghanistan, as evidence of the military's ability to be decisive under President Trump's leadership. But it was just last week that President Trump was saying a decision was made to send a warning message to North Korea by deploying U.S. warships to the waters off the Korean peninsula. It now seems that while he was making that announcement, saying that publicly on TV, those ships were actually headed in the opposite direction, headed south to participate in naval training exercises with the Australian military. Officials in Washington now say that the warships will make their way to the waters off the Korean peninsula but they won't arrive until the end of the month. So what was going on there? <WELL>, an administration official says there was a miscommunication with the Pentagon and lack of follow-up with commanders on the ground. But the announcements that this U.S. aircraft carrier strike group was headed towards the Koreas <CERTAINLY> enraged Pyongyang which said this was a move that threatened global security and it seems to have prompted another provocative act from North Korea, which test launched the missile. That test failed just over the weekend. But a senior North Korean official telling BBC that these missile launches will continue on a weekly basis. The Pentagon is saying it has plans next month to test its capacity to shoot down missiles -- Dave."

One particular series of incidents near the western area of Banias (ph) in March the 2nd or 3rd where up to 400 people may have been killed. And I should warn you, distressing details, some, in fact, seemingly killed by large objects being dropped on their heads. I mean, but the sheer brutality of what seems to happen every day here really brought home. Much of the sexual violence in this report, mostly lodged accusations against the regime for doing that. And some terrifying incidents too where it seems like rebels have, one instance, used a 13-year-old boy as a porter (ph) for Free Syrian Army soldiers operating near Dara (ph). He was seriously wounded. And a 15- year-old boy, this is more publicized instance (ph), accused of blasphemy by some Islamist radical rebels in the northern city of Aleppo and then executed for that.

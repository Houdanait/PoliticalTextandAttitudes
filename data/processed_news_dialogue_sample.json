The person that gets dropped into the State Department, he or she, is going to be somebody that the president-elect really thinks they can really fix the department and figure out what went wrong there.

It would probably take me 25 or 30 years to learn how to be a brain surgeon, but I don't think it's going to take that long to be a HUD secretary. Now, maybe I'm wrong about that. But my guess is, is that he's got the right social skills. He loves the country. And he understands the issues that we need to tackle right now in the country. And so I love the guy. I think he's terrific. But he's not a politician. I think that's the big message we have to send to people, that we're going to be putting nonpoliticians in these jobs to help disrupt the system a little bit and possibly make the system a lot better, Alisyn."

Court records show the man on your screen, 31-year-old Otis McCain got married on Monday before he was captured for allegedly shooting and killing Detective Benjamin Marconi. He was arrested six and a half hours later. McCain told reporters he was sorry for Marconi, and he said that he was lashing out in anger at the wrong person, because society wasn't allowing him to see his son."

The 34-year-old's leg was badly broken, but he still managed to swim through frigid waters to an island where he was finally rescued. Steven is going to join us live in our next hour to tell us about how he made it through and the image that was in his head the whole time that kept him going."

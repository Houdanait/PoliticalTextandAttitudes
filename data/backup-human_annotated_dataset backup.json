People -- many people are concerned that Donald Trump is going to do something that will be toxic and it will hurt their re-election campaign. There are many congressmen, many senators, and many people on the state level that are afraid that Donald Trump is going to cross a line and it will hurt everyone who is on a ticket, on a ballot at the same time. What people <NEED TO> understand <ABOUT> what Paul Ryan was saying this is, if you want everyone to get behind you, you are going to <HAVE TO> start acting like more of a statesman. You cannot quote the \"National Enquirer,\" throw it out there two days ago and then <EXPECT> everyone to get <AROUND> you just because you're willing to go to the lowest form of politics to try to destroy other Republicans.

        "statement": "How about that, Zoraida? There was one precinct we were waiting for. It was in Clinton County, Iowa. That's over in the east. You <KNOW>, guys, I looked them up, and Clinton County is actually most famous for at one point having the largest sawmill in the world, setting records with their, I <THINK>, fire response team. What <SEEMS> to have happened, why this took so long is there was that one precinct with results that <APPARENTLY> the state headquarters didn't tabulate. I spoke myself to the now famous Edith Pfeffer, the chairwoman of the Clinton County Republicans, spoke with her. She said, hey, we turned in those results not long after 7:00, sometime <AROUND> 7:40, 7:50. The problem, guys, seems to be that there were some tabulating issues here in Des Moines with the state headquarters. I <GUESS> they didn't realize that they didn't have those numbers. And this <MIGHT> happen a lot in elections. Usually it all gets squared away the next day. But, <OF COURSE>, here we were with an election resting on just a handful of votes. So every single precinct mattered. And when they discovered they were missing a couple, we had to wait and track down each one. Also, and then you can see and you're hearing video from, of course, all of the various candidate parties. Zoraida and Ashleigh, it was so interesting because here were these ballrooms full of supporters all night waiting to see their candidates, and the candidates really weren't <SURE> what to say for a while, especially Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney. They finally came out before the final results when it was <CLEAR> that this was virtually a tie. Back to you."

An estimated 800,000 federal workers <COULD> be furloughed. U.S. troops, as that woman mentioned, would not be paid on time. Processing of paper tax returns and refunds would stop. Passport applications would be processed at a slower pace. National parks and museums will close. Approval of small business loans will stop at SBA, no new FHA loans.

He has been talking for months about building a wall <OF COURSE>, he's been talking for months about not allowing Muslims to come into the U.S.. So Donald Trump brought that message into liberal urban Chicago. It simply was not welcome there. Most of the places he campaigns across the country have loud adoring supporters, we've seen him across the south and other places. But this is like coming into the belly of the beast, the liberal beast. They simply did not want Donald Trump's message here. So I think that a lot of the response was just the chance for Chicago and the democrats here, there is a democratic primary going on to just say no, we don't want Donald Trump. So in a sense it was a preview of what <COULD> be a general election contest. I mean, if Donald Trump <THINKS> that he can make Illinois competitive, if he thinks he can make Michigan competitive <SHOULD> he become the nominee this is what we could see. But I was struck just the earnestness of the protest. We talked to one demonstrator, one man who lived in the neighborhood where this rally was supposed to be going on. And this is why he said he came out to protest."

What is interesting here is that the European Union has called on these individual governments to launch their own investigations, mainly because they don't have the power to investigate further. It <SEEMS> highly <UNLIKELY> that any of these countries will do so. They will take cover under national security, saying that they won't be allowed to divulge this. There has been speculation that, in fact, a secret CIA prison was operating in both Poland and Romania. President Bush, back in September, admitted that these CIA prisons did exist. And, although they don't have any detainees in them right now, he wouldn't rule out the fact they would be used again in the future. This has really been an issue nagging at the European parliament. I <THINK> they don't want to have the taint of these kinds of secret clandestine transfers, interrogations, hanging over Europe. And so they have pushed this issue through to the parliament. As I said, there is <ABSOLUTELY> nothing that is legally binding about this. This issue, though, will continue to grind on in the European parliament. They expect to go through this report.

Now the president of the United States getting ready to speak. As we stand by to hear what he has to say, Fran Townsend is here; Tom Fuentes, former assistant director of the FBI; Gloria Borger and David Gergen, our senior political analysts. We're going to have full analysis afterwards. We're also going to be able to speak with the president's deputy national security adviser, Dennis McDonough, and try to fill in some of the blanks. No doubt, the president will say a lot that will sort of cry out for more questioning. We'll hear what they have to say about all these. Most important, David Gergen, right now we want specifics.

That's part of the election strategy that's been playing out here. But, Bianca, there's one more point to remember here. And that's right before the last election, Trump made a number of moves that were very <CLEARLY> pro-Netanyahu in an effort to try to get him elected: a blatant effort in terms of Israeli -- or American recognition of Israeli sovereignty in the Golan Heights, putting the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps on the terror list in the U.S., which Netanyahu took partial credit for. And that raises the question of what is it that Trump is going to do this time for Netanyahu. Whatever it is -- and it <COULD> be a number of different issues -- Netanyahu is not willing to put that in jeopardy this close to an election, and that, <PERHAPS>, another reason why Netanyahu wants to be seen as standing right with Trump on this issue."

He rejects all of that, frequently gives it the back of his hand. There are no interagency meetings, there is no deliberative process, and then often, what happens? We've seen it now. We've seen it many times in the past. When he is in discussion with an autocratic strongman leader, he finds that irresistible and often ends up agreeing to whatever they ask for.

Meteorologist Tom Sater is joining us from CNN headquarters in Atlanta for more on that. Tom, help us out.",
        "statement": "All right. Let's break it all down, Ana, because it's <QUITE> massive really in its scope here. This is the main chamber. OK. Kilauea, we've seen <OF COURSE> the plumes. The fissures that are opening up are releasing this energy from underground are good 20, 25 miles away., So the lava that was in the main chamber has been draining. It's been making its way underground for that 20 or 25 miles. So let's break this down, too. Each time we have one or what's leading up to these are the tremors. We've had hundreds of them. Many <AROUND> the summit and then on the east rift. And this is where the fissures have been opening up. Now we <THOUGHT> we had number 18 today. Hawaii Volcano Observatory said no, it's just 17. Because officially to have a fissure it needs to emit lava. So you can have the smoke, you can have the pressure and the gas. But it needs to emit lava. This is Leilani Estate. These are where the homes are. Notice we've got evacuation zones, we've got road closures. The green triangles are all the fissures. Now over the weekend and last week, there was no rhyme or reason to them. We've had a couple on Thursday that were to the southwest and a couple of more to the northeast. But these weekends have been the furthest to the east that we have seen which tells you that this is traveling underground until it gives. So as this lava is released, it is draining the main chamber. That's important to <KNOW> here. Take a look at this imagery that we've got from the USGS. It's a camera that looks down into the caldera. As the lava drops, which was at the top, it releases pressure so there's like landslides. There's debris that falling inside. Here is the lava on April 23rd. Now this is important because there is a fear that we <COULD> have a steam driven, massive, violent eruption if this lava drops all the way down to the water table which is at 1500 feet. Right now the lava is down almost 1200. A couple of feet a day. Another near little 3D imagery, technology is amazing here. From the USGS. they can tell us from using their high-tech cameras what this caldera or this chamber is actually shaped like. And it's getting down and tapering at the end which means debris is coming down which is going to cause pressure but it's also like packing a cannon. And when this thing goes, it's going to blow. Let's take a look another 3D area and you'll get an idea of exactly what we've been watching. So as the fissures again release the magma, we'll see the magma in the main chamber drop. If it gets down to this water level here, with all that debris inside, it doesn't mean it's going to happen but the elements are there. And if they interact just perfectly, this is where a massive eruption could occur like it did in 1924 where you had boulders that were eight tons, you know, size of a car, to 14 tons. Ana, that's like a semi tractor trailer truck that were blown a good half mile to even a mile away. So it's dropping quickly. It's a big concern. The more fissures that are expected, which will most likely happen, will drain more of that lava from the main caldera or that main chamber. So it's a little frightening but the tremors are going to continue to occur as this activity continues."

On is that we have many single-parent households in this country that if the mom is not employed, the family is going to be in poverty. We have many two- parent households in this country that it takes both families -- both of the parents working to keep the families out of poverty and with a good wage. This study, if you're just thinking about hours, we did not look at in this particular report what happens when you're putting -- subjecting children to living in poverty. And I think that's got to be part of the equation. The other thing that we have to look at is to know that, in fact, mothers are very important for children, but other social experiences also are important, opportunities to interact with other children, opportunities to interact with other adults, be that fathers, be that grandparents, and also child care providers. Children learn from these social experiences. Of course, the mother is important, but few people in this country believe that only the mother is important. We've had a long history of children going to nursery school. Very, very few children actually have experiences only with the mother. When I was a kindergarten teacher 25 years ago, the children that I actually worried about the most were children who had never been around other children or other caregivers. They came to school at a real disadvantage. And I think that pretending that only the mother is important for children is a mistake.",

A few is, you <KNOW>, being sarcastic. One of the major topics he addressed was Hillary Clinton's e-mail server controversy. Take a listen to what he told CNN's Jeff Zeleny."

It was also an occasion when Hezbollah leader really laid down the law as far as he's concerned about the future of Lebanon. He says he wants to see the current pro-U.S.-backed government, led by Prime Minister Fouad Siniora to step down and to make way for a new unity government that will be more pro-Syrian, and in effect close to Iran, Hezbollah's main supporter in terms of money and logistics. Now, this was Hassan Nasrallah appearing not without risk, he said, even some 30 minutes before he appeared, he said he was arguing with his own security advisers about whether or not he should appear in public. In the end he was on display throwing out rhetoric against Israel, against the United States, for more than an hour. \"A very important day,\" he said, \"A historic day, a day in which all Lebanese could celebrate what he called a divine victory over Israel.\"",

We've learned a lot here at the federal level: One, there needs to be better coordination between local and state government; secondly, that there needs to be a communications package that will be available to help deal with the situation that happened last time, which was total destruction of communications capabilities; third, that there needs to make <SURE> that there's a law enforcement alternative in case there's a breakdown of local law enforcement; fourthly, there needs to be a prepositioning of assets so that if a major storm were to come, we'd be able to move equipment in faster. But, most important, there needs to be a coordination and an understanding of the evacuation and relief plans. And I talked to the mayor and both governors that I met with yesterday about our seriousness in working with them to make sure that the plans are as effective as possible. The communications, obviously, this time <AROUND> are a lot better than last time around. And so the lessons are being learned. And my attitude toward the recommendations by Fran Townsend, who's a part of my administration, or the Congress, is we ought to take them all seriously. The objective is to respond to these natural disasters as well as we <POSSIBLY> can. The other issue down there for New Orleans, <OF COURSE>, is the levees. And we've got money in the supp to make sure that these levees are pre-Katrina or better prior to June 1st. I <THINK> we'll achieve that objective. There's -- additional money will be spent so that the levees are improved significantly by September of '07. The levees are important to -- the rebuilding of the levees or improving of the levees are very important to assure the people of New Orleans that if there is a storm, they're built to pre-Katrina levels, at least in the initial stage. But also it's important to convince people that it's OK to risk capital in New Orleans. The amazing thing in the area down there -- I don't <KNOW> if you all went with me, but it was -- there's -- it's a <TOTALLY> different attitude from when we were there before early on, obviously, after the storm. I mean, people are coming back. The sales tax along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi are higher today than they were a year ago this date and that's positive. But, look, there's still a lot of work to be done, a lot of reconstruction. The CDBG money -- and it's very important for the Congress to pass the CDBG money I requested so that the housing issue can get -- people can get back to rebuilding their homes. And Mississippi, the CDBG money will be coming out pretty quick. New Orleans, they still got a little work. The governor has proposed a plan that will be in front of the legislature I think this weekend. It's a very important step to getting this process moving. And so we've got a lot of work to do. But, yes, we're much more ready this time than last time and we're taking very seriously the lessons learned from Katrina."

        "previous_statement": "Good evening. I`m Nancy Grace. I want to thank you for being with us. Live, Tampa. Police race to a million-dollar mansion to find a little girl at her bedroom computer doing homework, dead, her little brother still buckled in the minivan, dead. Then they find Mommy out lounging by the luxury pool in the back yard, who calmly explains she guns down her two children, shooting them in the mouth, because they talked back. In the last hours, we hear from Mommy herself, Mommy`s journal, in which she details her innermost thoughts and feelings about how she`s going to shoot her children dead. Let`s take a look at what Mommy said in her own writing. This is what I observed in court. Mommy now has her hair pulled back, mousey brown, in a bun. She won`t look at any of the witnesses. She won`t turn around and look at her husband, Colonel Parker Schenecker. She sits there acting like she`s taking notes, as if nothing`s going on around her. But let`s take a look into Mommy`s life. Let`s see the screens, Liz - - what we learned that Mommy writes in her journal. I did all my duties. Then I went to buy a gun. I was planning a Saturday massacre, but had to wait for a background investigation for three days. Let`s keep it going. Calyx called me pathetic. On Saturday, she called me an evil soul. The evil starts Thursday. Calyx, you know what? She gets it first. Don`t know whether I`ll turn on the light (to blind) or just react to have me in her bedroom. I`m nervous. Next -- I offed Beau on the way to practice. I offed Beau on the way to practice. He saw the gun and told me to put it back in the purse. He had a healthy fight, then when we got home, a shot to his mouth (because) he became so mouthy, just like Calyx. Calyx drove me to drink. He (Beau) was yelling at me. The first shot hit the windshield. Second shot was the side of his head. Next shot to the mouth, his mouthy mouth. Came home. Calyx is on the upstairs computer. Asked, What are you doing? Just (seeing) what you are doing, walked up without her reacting and shot her in the right temple. Then shot her in the mouth (her sassy little mouth). Really tore my soul to the core. Shot the two mouthy mouths in the mouth after shooting them in the head. I`m just losing my mind. I`d like to die by Beau in our bed. That would be nice. Beau and I are going to heaven. Wish heaven for Calyx, too. \"Wish.\" Whoa! Lucky you weren`t there -- talking to her husband. Probably would have offed you, too. Would have been a crying shame. I sensed divorce was inevitable, but I can`t live alone.\" All right, straight out to Roger Schulman, Tampa radio reporter in court today, Roger with me in the courtroom all day yesterday. Roger, as I watched Colonel Parker Schenecker in the courtroom, I could tell he was about to burst into tears. Today, he was on the stand. What did you observe?",

We believe they have these permissions as we've heard from the director general of the OPCW, then you have the security situation on the ground, allowing them to enter the area and spend some time there. And as you mentioned earlier, their advanced security team on Tuesday when they're carrying out that reconnaissance mission to try and inspect the site ahead of the arrival of the OPCW fact-finding mission, they came under fire one of these locations and also an explosive device was detonated. But as we understand no one was hurt. We need to keep in mind what the scope of the mission of this OPCW fact-finding mission is going to be. It's not to assign blame. They need to establish the fact of whether an attack took place and what chemical was used, so they do need to get there as soon as possible and it's unclear when that's going to happen. When you're talking about what people there are saying, you know, Rosemary, activists and medical workers that we were speaking to right after the attack were warning that this area is now going to be under the control of the regime. It's going to be very difficult to get, you know, the accounts, the honest accounts, as they say, from people who are there in the area right now because they might feel that they are intimidated. They feel that they're scared of speaking freely in an area that is under control of the regime. These are people who have been living for years until rebel control and they've decided to stay in this area even after the regime took control. So it's very difficult to verify from people what really happened. And since the attack took place, Rosemary, there have been so many different stories competing narratives conspiracy theories from both sides here blaming each other for the attack, and in some cases saying an attack never took place.",

But now a check at this hour's latest developments: The American accused of joining al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan made his first court appearance today. John Walker Lindh is charged with four criminal counts, including conspiracy to kill Americans. Walker Lindh told a magistrate judge he understood the charges and that he <COULD> be sentenced to life in prison if convicted. Attorney General John Ashcroft says the United States could seek additional charges that carry the death penalty. In Afghanistan, U.S. Army special forces attacked two Taliban compounds today, killing about 12 fighters and taking 27 prisoners. The Pentagon says an American soldier was wounded, but his injury is not life-threatening. The fighting happened some 35 miles north of Kandahar. And here in Washington, supporters of campaign finance reform say they have collected 218 signatures, enough to force a vote on the issue on the House floor. No date has been set for debate and vote on the bill, which would virtually ban what's called soft money. Those are the unlimited sums that go to politicians. Campaign finance reform passed the Senate last year, but stalled in the House of Representatives. Widespread campaign donations by Enron helped fuel the move toward finance campaign reform in the House. And today, Capitol Hill began focusing on Enron's dramatic collapse. How did it happen and who knew what and when? Today, both the House and Senate opened hearings into the matter. From Capitol Hill, our congressional Kate Snow, she joins us now with more on who is talking and who is not talking -- Kate."

I think the other question that Senator Warner left out is not only how high this goes, but how broadly, how wide this goes. Because, this, while coming clearly under the umbrella of a Russian effort to help the candidate, Trump, is around a fairly narrow set of questions. It does not, at least on the last information we have so far, which is probably not the last war we're going to have in this meeting. At least on the information we have so far does not yet implicate the question of either the hacking of the DNC and John Podesta's e-mail and or which I think is also an important area of investigation that the role of Russian agencies in spreading fake news and you know, misleading news stories targeted into key states in the U.S. election. And whether they had any help in deciding where from Moscow to target those efforts. I mean, those are, in many ways, the broader questions that most of the public is still focused on. This meeting at this point does not yet address that. But one thing I feel pretty confident about is that, as these stories have shifted, it's just under the glare of the news media.

Is the Pakistani military which is engaging in operations in Waziristan capable of controlling the Taliban, capable of trying to stave off these attacks and if not, what does that mean for the region?",
        "statement": "You <KNOW>, it's too early to tell. I mean, I <THINK> actually on the whole, things, despite the bombing, things are more promising in Pakistan than they have been in the last six or seven months. You know, the Pakistani's army move -- the army's moving to South Waziristan I think is an important development and it <COULD> have real ripple effects into Afghanistan, too. You know, if you take away these safe havens from the Taliban in Pakistan, it makes them much less effective in Afghanistan."

I <THINK> that he, like every other leader, can tell you we're scratching our heads over Burma. Because all this has happened in three weeks. You have almost 1/2 a million people who have left and the tragedies and abuse that happened there is something that a lot of people cannot stomach.

We're going to tell you when to take your kid to the M.D. and when to head straight to the E.R. And Congress isn't known for simplifying stuff, so we'll see what kind of clarity it can bring to the confusion over cancer screenings. We'll hit the hearing on Capitol Hill. Really quickly right now, we're waiting on the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, to come out for a briefing. The first time the White House will take questions since the president's speech last night. And, of course, we're expecting a lot of questions about the Afghan war strategy. We'll hit that as soon as it starts. And now for something completely extraordinary: General Stanley McChrystal, in Kandahar, addressing U.S. troops and Afghan leaders, talking about the new plan and how he plans to push it forward. CNN got access, exclusive access, that you just don't see that often: the top commander talking about the road ahead. He wrapped up just about an hour ago. Here you go.",

I believe that by this time next year we'll see a level of progress that will convince us that we can <CLEARLY> articulate the progress and predict the effect -- the effectiveness of our operations. And I believe that by the summer of 2011, that will be obvious to all the players involved: to the Taliban, to the insurgents, I <THINK> it will be obvious to the Afghan national security forces. It will be obvious to us, and it will be obvious to the Afghan people in all of those areas. And that's the critical point. So that we can offer them the confidence that we're going to be able to provide that security. Counterinsurgency starts, as you <KNOW>, with protecting the people, because at the end of the day, the people are what we are here for. We're here to respect the Afghan people. We're here to protect the Afghan people. We're here to enable the Afghan people, to build their country. We're not going to nation-build. What we are going to do is allow a nation to nation-build. Now our mission is to prevent the insurgency from being an existential threat to the government of Afghanistan and prevent al Qaeda, or other international terrorists, from using Afghanistan as a safe haven. If you think about where we are now, even though it's eight years, this is not the end. This is not even the beginning of the end.

Broken trust. After meeting with President Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel says Europe can no longer completely rely on others; and Germany's foreign minister says President Trump's actions have put Europe's peace at risk. Is a crucial alliance on rocks? Democratic terrorism? Domestic terrorism. The FBI is investigating a violent attack on a commuter train after two men are killed trying to stop a man yelling anti-Muslim slurs at two young women. The president tweets that the victim stood up to hate and intolerance. Was this a hate crime and domestic terrorism? And catastrophic war. North Korea launches its third missile in three weeks as Defense Secretary James Mattis warns a conflict with North Korea could be catastrophic. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. President Trump honors America's fallen on this Memorial Day, laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns and visiting the graves of service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. But as the commander in chief considers boosting America's battle against terrorism, the White House is now on the defensive amid growing questions about contacts with Russia, including what sources say was an effort by the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to set up a pre-inauguration secret backchannel link to Russia. While a former CIA director finds that move appalling, homeland security secretary John Kelly says it's no big deal. Sources say the White House is preparing a war room to combat the growing number of allegations and leaks as multiple Russia investigations gather momentum. And new controversies are arising from the president's recent overseas trip. After meetings dominated by friction with President Trump over climate, trade and defense, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, says Europeans must, quote, \"take our fate into our own hands,\" while her foreign minister says President Trump's actions are putting Europe's peace at risk. I'll talk to Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego, an Iraq War veteran. He's on the Armed Services Committee. And our correspondents, specialists and guests, they're standing by with full coverage of the day's top stories. President Trump's son-in-law is the lightning rod as a new storm batters the White House.

There's new concern this morning about ISIS. Attacks by U.S. soil by ISIS-inspired terrorists. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security are warning law enforcement personnel and the news media that they could be targeted by ISIS militants. Law enforcement officials tell CNN that a security bulletin with the warning is based on chatter and extremist forums and on social media. It's not on any specific threat. It is based on chatter. In Iraq, ISIS is advancing on Baghdad, despite further airstrikes over the weekend by the U.S.-led coalition. More than 30 suspected ISIS fighters in Iraq were killed in an air strike Saturday, on an armed convoy west of Ramadi. But officials say ISIS is moving aggressively, dispatching as many as 10,000 fighters to Anbar province from Syria and from Mosul. Standing by live in Baghdad this morning, senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman. Ben, you know, Anbar is very close to Baghdad. Do these moves by ISIS represent a serious threat to the capital?",

So, the focus of their efforts up until now has not been so much the area <AROUND> Baghdad, although they are out there and they do occasionally make hit-and-run attacks on the defensive perimeter to the west of the city. But really, their focus is on towns like Ramadi, where yesterday the police chief was killed for the entire -- the police chief for an entire province was killed in a roadside bombing; in other towns along the Euphrates River, where they clearly want to get a foothold. But Baghdad itself, at the moment, is <WELL>-defended according to U.S. officials. There is a problem, of course, of frequent car bombs. There is a car bomb at least one every day at the capital. In <FACT>, on Saturday night there were two that killed more than 40 people. So, the concern of the Iraqi security officials itself has more to do with the threat of these car bombs presumably from ISIS within the city and not so much as these occasional probing attacks on this city's defense -- Christine."

One room was disorderly with clothes crumpled, lying on the floor; also brand- new clothes still in their packets. They said there was a rudimentary kitchen where there was some running water. And then as the troops were searching right <AROUND> that building, somebody noticed some soil that didn't look right on the ground, a rug that didn't look right on the floor. When they pulled back that rug -- and this was just in the dirt in the wood side by this building outdoors -- then they discovered what appeared to be a polystyrene cork, if you will, in this concrete hole. And it was in this tiny concrete hole, <ABOUT> six feet by eight feet, that Saddam Hussein was hiding. And they say that he came out without a fight, that he came out and he was looking disheveled, and very, very quickly he was taken away. So it was really the soldiers spotting that something didn't look right in the dirt on the ground, something that had been heavily camouflaged, something that had been designed to <AVOID> capture.

Gay couples in Washington state are <PROBABLY> hearing wedding bells right now. State lawmakers have approved a same-sex marriage bill, making Washington the seventh state to take such action.

The Senate passed the measure last week, it now goes to Governor Chris Gregoire, she calls the vote historic and promises to sign that bill. Illinois <COULD> be the next state. Illinois <COULD> be the next state to consider legalizing same-sex marriage. Three lawmakers have filed a measure that would eliminate the part of state law that now explicitly prohibits gay marriage. Women in the U.S. military can expect new roles placing them even closer to the combat zone. The defense department said that possibility will occur when it opens up nearly 14,000 new jobs to military women. Right now, women are restricted from serving in small ground units involved in combat. So, for the past decade, many have served in support positions that have put them in harm's way anyway. Some of the new jobs include tank or artillery mechanics, field surgeons in forward position, and crew members on missile launchers. A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by the animal rights group PETA that SeaWorld was enslaving killer whales for human amusement. The judge ruled the 13th Amendment that prohibits slavery does not apply to non-humans. The judge called slavery an involuntary servitude uniquely human activities. SeaWorld says the lawsuit was a baseless publicity stunt, but PETA says it will pursue other avenues to help SeaWorld's five killer whales. The U.N. is calling it appalling brutality. Crime so horrible, outcomes so gruesome, we can't even show you on television. Coming up next, the desperate situation in Syria growing even more dire.

Now, all along, Carol, there had been two major issues crippling this process, the role of religion and the notion of federalism. On the former, we're told an agreement has been reached in principle. The head of Iraq's National Assembly telling me earlier that Islam will be \"a main source of Iraqi legislation.\" That will raise concerns among women's rights groups, who had hoped Islam would simply \"a\" source, one of many, something they felt was necessary to ensure their rights. It will also raise questions about role, how prominent a role religious clerics will play in the new Iraq. But that other issue, federalism, is emerging as an impasse. The Kurds want explicit reference to it in the constitution, maintaining an autonomous region in the north. The Sunnis want all talk of federalism sidelined until a new government comes into power. And the Shia are perhaps split. Some of them are calling for an autonomous region in the country's south. Others are calling for a unified, single Iraq. So that is what they are working to try and find compromise on, Carol. They have now just about 10 hours to try and do that -- Carol.",

What's so interesting about Santorum -- and I agree with everything that's been said here. His travels through the 99 counties. He's had more than 300 town halls in the last year alone. Let's not forget that Iowa voters put a tremendous premium on retail politicking. They like to see the candidate eye to eye. It's been said Santorum <MAY> have bought every GOP Iowa caucus-goer a cup of coffee. That may be able to take him to victory tonight if he has those passionate followers at each of these caucuses that can make the case that these religious conservative social voters will be able to vote for somebody that they really can <FEEL> good about.

It would have intersected with what was a hijacking a year and a half ago in December of 2012. It was blamed on Uighurs on a flight flying across that western bit of China.

I think it's really quite good that we're able to run $160 billion surplus when we have effectively zero growth in the economy or something close to that. But what it means is we're going to generate substantial surpluses beyond Social Security revenues when the economy returns to a more natural rate of real growth.",

His office tells us they <MAY> have something posted on their website shortly. Now, does all of this mean he's contesting the sale of the Clippers? <MAYBE>. Maybe not.

That's the bottom line.\" That's a quote from Max Blecher to me on the phone earlier today. I don't <KNOW> what the lawsuit means versus what he said to me about contesting the sale, Wolf. Another key piece of news we have today. Sources telling us the doctors have determined Donald Sterling to be mentally incapacitated. This was a finding by two independent doctors, neurologists, presumably, we <BELIEVE>, earlier this month in two different examinations. And we have learned from one source that there is a clause in the trust between Donald and Shelly Sterling that says if one of them were to become mentally unfit, then the other would be the sole trustee. And that presumably opened the door for her to negotiate that sale with Steve Ballmer. Again, I tried to get reaction. I did get reaction from Maxwell Blecher to that finding. He said that's a vast overstatement of mental incapacitation. That this was a diagnosis really of, quote, \"modest mental impairment.\" And that maybe something akin to just slowing down mentally. And he is basically saying that mental incapacitation is not the case. At least not that degree of it."

We are, of course, now hearing these live pictures from Baghdad air raid sirens. If things unfold in Baghdad the way they usually do, it looks like we're first seeing the first AAA antiartillery aircraft artillery possibly go off. The Iraqis have a long history in these types of events of very quickly turning on their air raid sirens looking at these live pictures, turning on their antiaircraft authority, basically shooting a wall of steel into the sky if they believe U.S. aircraft or U.S. Tomahawk missiles are coming at them. I suspect as this begins to unfold, we will see more activity in the sky. We can tell you it is a well-known fact, U.S. B-52 bombers took off from England earlier today. We are not saying their destination. We are not saying their flying time. We're not saying where they're going. They often take off on various missions. They may or may not be involved in what will unfold over Baghdad. Continuing to look at these pictures, it's not unexpected that we will continue to see air activity over Baghdad. The U.S. administration, of course -- it looks like another tracer there off to the right of your screen. The U.S. administration struggling with when to exactly begin the air bombardment of Baghdad. They had been hoping all the way along that the Iraqi military would basically revolt against the regime of Saddam Hussein, a very heavy propaganda campaign, of course, going on in the last days here, trying to convince the Iraqi military that they had no hope of winning, even rumors in the last several hours that a Republican Guard division was ready to defect. So there had been a sense of maybe waiting a bit, seeing if the Iraqi military would basically give up, seeing if the leadership would turn against Saddam Hussein. The last two nights of their airstrikes we have seen over Baghdad have, in fact, been very much aimed at leadership, military targets aimed at Saddam Hussein, his family, his top advisers. They had called them, you know, decapitation strikes, but now it looks like other things could be unfolding in the hours ahead -- Wolf.",

What we found there were the types of problems I described and really <PROBABLY> the most compelling was the lack of adequate pediatric medical specialty. Such that we identified it, while we were on site of a small infant who was suffering from diarrhea illness. And under the watchful eye of well-meaning but typically adult trained clinicians, the baby lost a critical amount of weight and was severely dehydrated. Really when we identified the case, we alerted the government that this was a near miss. The child actually well <COULD> have died of a simple and treatable medical condition of dehydration. It was at that point we felt the safety of children in that facility was so impaired that we recommend that they shut down that facility. And indeed, they did."

And they had talked, according to the White House, <ABOUT> how to handle the news, that they wanted the news, when it was confirmed, to come out of the theater, as the White House is putting it, they wanted the military to announce it, because that is the <<KIND OF>> operation that it was. But there was concern, according to the White House, from the president, that <<PERHAPS>> it was an impostor, that it wasn't Saddam Hussein. But as you mentioned, it was today that the president did get <FINAL WORD>. And he started working the phones, Wolf. He's talked to a number of allies, <ABOUT> a dozen leaders, already this morning, making phone calls to talk <ABOUT> the issue, to congratulate some of them, and just to inform them that this is indeed Saddam Hussein."

What the parents are doing is overcompensating for things they didn't get. They make rules like no dribble basketball or no score soccer so no one feels bad and any time someone feels bad, the world is supposed to stop to make them feel better. What you know in life is there are two ways to make it. You can make a living or you can make a life, which is how you change lives. Too many people are making a living and not changing lives.",

We do think this is going to take some time. I think most forecasters believe that. It would be great if we got a whole bunch more months of job creation like that, notwithstanding that, as I mentioned, there are just a lot of people that are unemployed.",
        "statement": "Powell was making a reference to last month's job creation of 2.5 million. Let's take a look at the tally where we stand today, John. I talked <ABOUT> 13 percent, it's above that. We're <HOPING> to get to 9 percent by the end of the year, according to the Federal Reserve. But we put up 2021 or 2022 because the numbers are still high -- 6.5 percent and 5.5 percent of the United States is historically high. Our run rate for the jobless rate is <ABOUT> 4 percent. We have weekly claims coming out today. As I've talked to you <ABOUT> before, the trend line is coming down. So we're below 2 million. Expectations are for 1.5 million. But if you look at the tally -- and this has been the major concern of the Federal Reserve -- we're going to be bumping up over 44 million people filing for claims. That's why one in four in America and why Powell talks <ABOUT> the hardship."

        "previous_statement": "Al Gore is back. This time it will cost you to see him. The former vice president's featured in the film \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" which opens in theaters in May. It's a documentary. It follows Gore and his fight against global warming from when he was a student at Harvard until today. Since losing the 2000 presidential race, Gore has spent much of his time traveling the world and lecturing about what he calls a planetary emergency. The columnist Richard Cohen writes that, although this film is about the most boring of topics, it will ultimately captivate, rivet and scare you because of where planet Earth is headed. Cohen writes, \"It may be that Gore will do more good for his country and the world with this movie than Bush ever did by beating him in 2000.\" Here's the question: Should politicians like Al Gore be making movies? E-mail your thoughts to caffertyfile@CNN.com or go to CNN.com/caffertyfile -- Wolf.",
        "statement": "Thanks, Jack. We'll get back to you later this hour. Coming up, gas prices sky high at the pump. Are oil companies gouging consumers, or is it simply a matter of supply and demand? We'll find out why one U.S. senator wants a federal investigation right now. Plus, bad management? Find out why Osama bin Laden is getting a bad review from a fellow terrorist. We have the inside story. Brian Todd on that. And Hillaryisms, sayings that <COULD> come back to bite. Only our Jeanne Moos has a look at the book, the controversy, what's going on with the former first lady. Stay with us. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM."

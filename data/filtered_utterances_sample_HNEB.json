He's a preeminent Islamic scholar in the world today, and he said that what is important for people to realize today, he said, he was an intelligent officer in the British Army in the 1940s. He was more optimistic <ABOUT> a victory of the West then, after the Nazis had taken over Poland, Czechoslovakia and France than he is now, over the victory of the West over radical Islam. And I asked him why, that's such a shocking statement. And he said because, then we knew who we were and we knew who they were. We were the Western world, which was freedom and Democracy and individual rights and they were totalitarian dictators who were trying to destroy our way of life. Today, he said, we don't <KNOW> who we are, we don't <KNOW> what we stand for in the West and we don't <KNOW> that there's an enemy that is trying to -- has declared war and is trying to destroy the West. And, therefore, the first important message to, answer your <QUESTION>, and this is what we try to get across in \"Obsession\" the movie, is people <NEED TO> understand that there is a war going on today. It's not something that we asked for, but there are people, just as there was in the Nazis in the 1930s and '40s, there are people and it is the minority of Muslims like Nonie says, but there are radical Islamists and there are millions of them who are trying to declare war and destroy civilization, Western civilization. We <HAVE TO> be aware of and it educate ourselves. That's the <MOST IMPORTANT> <THING> that needs to happen today."

And Justin just kept it <POSITIVE> and mobilized a lot -- I mean, the voter turnout rate was as high as it was almost to 1993. It's a really high voter turnout rate.

From the beginning, we reported our concerns that detention of children, regardless of the conditions of confinement is harmful to their health. But in addition, we observed systemic problems in meeting their complex needs. We found problems recruiting and retaining qualified pediatricians, pediatric mental health experts, there were problems acquiring interpretation. Many of these children speak indigenous languages and interpretation services are difficult to find, making the medical transaction very fraught and risky. And we found problems across a number of facilities with the physical design of the facilities which often wasn`t well planned to keep children safe. So, in addition to knowing the detention is harmful, we found that the government was having trouble meeting its own minimal standards for the health and safety of children.",

As you said, Republicans were very concerned they were going to have nobody at the top of the ticket across the state. Now they have the possibility for two. The -- John Cox, the business man, will face Gavin Newsom, former San Francisco mayor, for the governorship. And in the Senate race, Dianne Feinstein, it's not clear who she will face, whether it will be somebody from her left, Kevin de Leon, or Jim Bradley, a businessman from Orange County. The other concern that Democrats here had, they were targeting ten different districts of Republican, trying to flip those seats. Seven of them are seats where -- where -- Republicans where Hillary Clinton won those districts. They were concerned they were going to get locked out of one, two, possibly three. It looks like, in all of those districts, that Democrats will be No. 2 in all of them. There are two that are still somewhat of a question. Number -- District 10, Jeff Denham, the Republican, will face either Josh Harder or Ted Howze. And in the 48th, there are two Democrats and a Republican vying for that No. 2 spot. All of this could take some time to figure out, because in one case, 188,000 were left off the voter rolls in Los Angeles County, so they had to fill out paper ballots. Those had to be counted. And mail-in ballots. People could walk up on election day and even mail them in on election day. Those will take time to count. So we may see this -- a couple of these races that may be days, if not weeks, before we know the final answer. Back to you guys.",

And we haven't even come to the real military response. Most people think that this was the official response, and that there will be continued actions by Iran, with some plausible deniability.

And as you mentioned earlier, their advanced security team on Tuesday when they're carrying out that reconnaissance mission to try and inspect the site ahead of the arrival of the OPCW fact-finding mission, they came under fire one of these locations and also an explosive device was detonated. But as we understand no one was hurt. We need to keep in mind what the scope of the mission of this OPCW fact-finding mission is going to be. It's not to assign blame. They need to establish the fact of whether an attack took place and what chemical was used, so they do need to get there as soon as possible and it's unclear when that's going to happen. When you're talking about what people there are saying, you know, Rosemary, activists and medical workers that we were speaking to right after the attack were warning that this area is now going to be under the control of the regime. It's going to be very difficult to get, you know, the accounts, the honest accounts, as they say, from people who are there in the area right now because they might feel that they are intimidated.

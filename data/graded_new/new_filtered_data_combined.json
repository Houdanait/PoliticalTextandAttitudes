Travel already a mess, really, for millions throughout the plains states and the Midwest, dealing with their second blizzard in a week. From northern Texas to Illinois, roads are closed.

Well, CNN has learned that federal authorities down in Arkansas are now actively investigating the Clinton family foundation for public corruption -- alleged public corruption. A U.S. official tells me that the FBI and federal prosecutors down in Little Rock are specifically digging into whether foundation donors were improperly promised policy favors or special access to Clinton while she was secretary of state in exchange for donations to the charity's coffers. They're examining whether non-profit tax laws were followed. CNN reported back in November of 2016 that the FBI had opened preliminary inquiries into whether there had been any sort of impropriety with the foundation's dealings and money and that caused some tensions within the bureau and the Justice Department. And so, the current inquiry, at least in part, as a continuation of that probe, that originated before the presidential election, but what's unclear is precisely what new evidence, if any, ignited the current federal investigation after those initial inquiries were stalled. Now the Clinton camp is pushing back very hard against this news as Nick Merrill, a spokesman, for Clinton told me. Let's call this what it is, a sham, and a spokesperson for the Clinton Foundation said the Clinton Foundation has been subjected to politically motivated allegations and time after time those allegations have been proven false. Nevertheless, this probe comes in the midst of a really sensitive time for the Justice Department under this administration as the president continues to demand time after time that his political rival be investigated while the Justice Department stays silent -- Ana.",

One room was disorderly with clothes crumpled, lying on the floor; also brand- new clothes still in their packets. They said there was a rudimentary kitchen where there was some running water. And then as the troops were searching right <AROUND> that building, somebody noticed some soil that didn't look right on the ground, a rug that didn't look right on the floor. When they pulled back that rug -- and this was just in the dirt in the wood side by this building outdoors -- then they discovered what appeared to be a polystyrene cork, if you will, in this concrete hole. And it was in this tiny concrete hole, <ABOUT> six feet by eight feet, that Saddam Hussein was hiding. And they say that he came out without a fight, that he came out and he was looking disheveled, and very, very quickly he was taken away. So it was really the soldiers spotting that something didn't look right in the dirt on the ground, something that had been heavily camouflaged, something that had been designed to <AVOID> capture.

Our special coverage of this Fourth of July continues with the Bush administration saying the nation's aviation system is on the highest alert after a gunman opened fire at the Los Angeles Airport. At a news conference a short while ago, FBI and local Los Angeles officials said this appears to be an isolated incident and they have no evidence, they say, that this was a terrorist attack. But details still are sketchy. We know the shooting happened just about three-and-a-half hours ago, close to the ticket counter of Israel's El Al Airline in the Thomas Bradley international terminal. Police say that three people have died, including the gunman who was killed by El Al security personnel. At least three other people were wounded. There is no official word yet on the gunman's identity or any motive. Thousands of people were evacuated from the Bradley terminal. That terminal remains closed, no air traffic in or out. Domestic flights are still continuing, though, at the rest of Los Angeles Airport. Now all this comes, of course, amid heightened security because it is the Fourth of July holiday. The first Fourth since 9/11. Again, the FBI is saying there is no evidence that this is terrorist related, and, at this point, they say they are not looking for other suspects. Let's go live now to the Los Angeles Airport to our own Charles Feldman. Charles, you were there when officials had this news conference that ended less than a half an hour ago, and they are saying at this point they think it's isolated?",
        "statement": "Yes, Judy. In <FACT>, they are. But let me also share with you and our audience some new information that I've just obtained from a law-enforcement source. And while what you said is <QUITE> accurate, Judy, that, at the news conference law-enforcement officials stressed that they at the moment are not looking for any other <SUSPECTS>, I can tell you this. A law-enforcement source tells me that an individual who is being questioned now by the LAPD and is about to be turned over to the FBI for further questioning is an individual, who according to eyewitnesses, had <APPARENTLY> been seen associating earlier in the morning with the alleged gunman, and that is the reason why this individual was taken into custody. There's a helicopter -- there have helicopters going back and forth. I apologize for the level of noise and the distraction, Judy. So I <HOPE> you and the audience can hear what I'm saying. I'll keep on going. According to a -- to the law-enforcement source, this individual was seen apparently in the accompaniment of the alleged shooter, according to eyewitnesses. He was taken into custody within moments of the shooting. He is not, however, being called a <SUSPECT>. He has not been placed under arrest. And that's very significant. He has simply been taken into for questioning and is now, I'm told, being handed over to the FBI to find out whether or not it was just an accidental -- a brush encounter that he <MAY> have had. And, actually, I don't <KNOW> if it's a he. They used the pronoun \"he,\" but -- It may be a she, but we're told he. We don't know whether he just met casually the alleged shooter or whether he may have been in some way associated with the shooter, but he is in custody. He is being questioned and turned over to the FBI. It is extremely noisy here. I'm going to do my <BEST> to hear your question, Judy. So go ahead and ask it."

He's been vilifying him over Twitter and in actual press conferences for <QUITE> some time. But he was very cautious not to fire Mueller because there would be obvious political consequences, particularly during the midterm elections. So now he can say, I didn't fire Mueller. I didn't touch Mueller. I also didn't touch Rod Rosenstein. I have no issue with him following the New York Times revelation that <MAYBE> the 25th amendment being talked about or him wearing a wire. I'm just going to replace the person who made it possible that Rod Rosenstein would have his position and Mueller would have oversight by that person. And so, by putting Matthew Whitaker in the position, which by the way is not in line of succession. It would naturally go to the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, then to a solicitor general. The chief of staff or the A.G. is not the person who is supposed to be in line. And so, one has to first wonder by what authority he's going to put him there. But the president already told us he's temporary. He'll have a more permanent placement put there in the long run. So, I'm wondering if in many ways this is the president's attempt to gain information about the investigation. So, once he's downloaded everything and debriefed from Robert Mueller and then he walks away to have a permanent replacement who is Senate- confirmed come in, well, <GUESS> what Donald Trump has? He's got the keys to the castle."

Fair enough. The president, <OF COURSE>, doesn't talk in legal terms, he talks in lay terms and he <FEELS> that he's under siege or under investigation, broadly speaking. Those things are not necessarily in conflict with one another. With respect to the president being -- having received advice about the firing of Comey and acting on that advice, the president said that that's not true. He said that he fired him because he had Russia on his mind and that he was going to fire him regardless of those recommendations from sessions and Comey. And, of course, it is not the Justice Department who is investigating the president now, it is the special counsel. And the reason there is a special counsel is that it would be ironic if the Justice Department were investigating him because they would have a conflict of interest. So there is no irony there because they appointed Mueller to do that which they couldn't do themselves without conflict.

And that is that after the latest meeting of the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, along with his inner security cabinet, which went into the early morning hours our time here in Israel. The decision has been made, quote, \"to hold off on a military ground offensive to give time, limited time,\" this in the words of that government official, \"time to let the diplomatic solution work.\" According to Israel, their nonnegotiable demand is that any diplomatic solution means an end to Hamas rocket fire into Israel. So that is what is happening now. Consistent with what we've been reporting over the last many hours that they do prefer to see a diplomatic solution succeed and they're giving time for it, but not endless time. They confirmed that the military is prepared and ready, should order for a ground offensive into Gaza be given. Now it does make sense that there would be more time given for diplomacy because, as we know, Hillary Clinton, the U.S. Secretary of State, is being dispatched here by President Obama. She's broken off from that meeting in Asia and she's coming here to the region. She'll land here in Israel late tonight our time. Her first meeting will be with the prime minister of Israel then she goes on to meet the Palestinians on the West Bank. Now these are not Hamas Palestinians. This is the Palestinian Authority that's recognized by the U.S. and Israel. And then, she will then go to Egypt and talk with Egypt's President Mohamed Morsy and Egypt is taking the lead in this negotiations with Hamas. So U.S. believes that Egypt is playing a very concrete and positive role, and so it looks like all sides are prepared to give some more time for diplomacy to be worked out.",

Because he ensured that <SORT OF> flow over the past five years of economic and military aid from the United States to Ukraine which they have used to prosecute their war in east against the pro-Russian rebels and their diplomatic campaign as well to try and get back territories seized by Russia in Crimea in 2014.

You <KNOW>, look, I mean, in terms of his testimony we'll see what he says, and we'll be able to gauge better after that testimony <OBVIOUSLY> about (Inaudible). But Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer is attempting to argue that Kurt Volker is in on his scheme to try and get the Ukrainians to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and other issues as well like 2016 election meddling. The understanding we have of what Kurt Volker's role was as far as he is concerned, is trying to help the Ukrainians navigate the sort of conflicting difficult demands with the Trump administration was putting on the new government of Volodymyr Zelensky. So, for instance, he set up a meeting after the July 25th phone call, he set up a meeting in Madrid between Giuliani and someone called Andriy Yermak who is one of President Zelensky's closest political aide. We don't know the content of their discussion were, but our understanding is, it was to, you know, to see what it was for the Trump administration really wanted. <PERHAPS> that will come out in the testimony, that's why we're all going to be watching here in the Ukraine very closely indeed."

So far he has spoken with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak earlier this morning. He had two conversations with Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, and one talk with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. White House officials are not offering many details about those conversations except to say that the president is working hard to try to stem all forms of violence in the region, and working with all sides to restore calm, and get back to the peace process.

Another issue Mr. Clinton and the rest of the White House national security team is very focused on is a proposed United Nations Security Council resolution dealing with the violence between the Israelis and the Palestinians over these past several days.

        "previous_statement": "Wolf, there has been tension here at the Pentagon all day about when things would begin to unfold. We are, of course, now hearing these live pictures from Baghdad air raid sirens. If things unfold in Baghdad the way they usually do, it looks like we're first seeing the first AAA antiartillery aircraft artillery possibly go off. The Iraqis have a long history in these types of events of very quickly turning on their air raid sirens looking at these live pictures, turning on their antiaircraft authority, basically shooting a wall of steel into the sky if they believe U.S. aircraft or U.S. Tomahawk missiles are coming at them. I suspect as this begins to unfold, we will see more activity in the sky. We can tell you it is a well-known fact, U.S. B-52 bombers took off from England earlier today. We are not saying their destination. We are not saying their flying time. We're not saying where they're going. They often take off on various missions. They may or may not be involved in what will unfold over Baghdad. Continuing to look at these pictures, it's not unexpected that we will continue to see air activity over Baghdad. The U.S. administration, of course -- it looks like another tracer there off to the right of your screen. The U.S. administration struggling with when to exactly begin the air bombardment of Baghdad. They had been hoping all the way along that the Iraqi military would basically revolt against the regime of Saddam Hussein, a very heavy propaganda campaign, of course, going on in the last days here, trying to convince the Iraqi military that they had no hope of winning, even rumors in the last several hours that a Republican Guard division was ready to defect. So there had been a sense of maybe waiting a bit, seeing if the Iraqi military would basically give up, seeing if the leadership would turn against Saddam Hussein. The last two nights of their airstrikes we have seen over Baghdad have, in fact, been very much aimed at leadership, military targets aimed at Saddam Hussein, his family, his top advisers. They had called them, you know, decapitation strikes, but now it looks like other things could be unfolding in the hours ahead -- Wolf.",

I want to continue to show our viewers these live pictures of Baghdad, just the last two nights <AROUND> this time, <APPROXIMATELY> just shortly after it gets dark in this part of the world, there were U.S.-led strikes, selected targets the first night, second night. Now on this third night, we anticipate there <COULD> be more activity. Clearly the Iraqi air defense systems have been on alert and the Iraqi triple air fire antiaircraft fire already being seen over the skies over Baghdad. We'll continue to show our viewers these pictures. I want to bring back CNN's Martin Savidge. He's in southern Iraq. He's still with the First Battalion 7th Marines. Marty, I assume you can't see these pictures, but tell our viewers, I interrupted you before, what you're doing, where you are and <APPROXIMATELY> what the mission is as far as you can tell from your location.

They're <HOPING> to knock down <PERHAPS> a cruise missile. They're firing.

        "previous_statement": "Now, the president has put Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill in charge of working with Congress on this mix of tax cuts and spending increases to try to the stimulate economy. Paul O'Neill, the treasury secretary, was here on Capitol Hill a little while ago at a hearing, outlined some of the principles. They are, first of all, a price tag. For the first time, the administration saying they would like to see a stimulus plan that would total between 60 and 75 billion dollars. They have three major components here. One, for individuals, some mix of possibly accelerated tax cuts, possibly accelerating those tax cuts that Congress has already passed. And by the way, I believe we have pictures now of the president just arriving back in the Washington area at Andrews Air Force Base, coming out of Air Force One. Again, the three major principles of this economic stimulus plan that the president is talking about. One, accelerated tax cuts for individuals to try to get consumers buying again. Also, tax cuts for businesses. And finally financial support, direct financial support for those that have been directly affected by the September 11th attacks. Now, meanwhile when Treasury Secretary O'Neill was up here on Capitol Hill -- there's Bush going into Marine One, headed back toward the White House. When the treasury secretary was up here on Capitol Hill, he said that the economy -- he sees clear signs that the economy is starting to get back on the right foot. And that's a very important point, because what we've learned about those rebate checks that went out, which were supposed to be economic stimulus checks, those $300 rebate checks that went out to individuals, is that the Treasury Department says only about 18 percent of that money was actually put back into the economy. With the economic slowdown, individuals were saving that money, not spending it: therefore, not much economic stimulus. So what Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill trying to do on Capitol Hill here is also to try to reinvigorate faith in the American economy, because without consumer confidence, all this question of economic stimulus probably won't have much effect, because individuals, not confident about the economy, may not go out and spend the economic stimulus. Much debate going on here about this as we go forward -- Judy.",

And Bernie made off with billions, now his victims have scored a victory. I'm Richard Quest, in good voice. And, I mean business. Good evening. A good dose of relief and easy breathing, plenty of space and lots of cash. It is just what the cash strapped Euro Zone needed today. Spain and Italy join Portugal in conducting successful fundraising exercises. The interest rates definitely hurt, but they didn't deliver the fatal blow. For now, it seems, no nation needs a bailout. It gives euro leaders vital thinking time to work out how to defend themselves against the next crisis of confidence. If you'll join me in the library, you'll see exactly how the auctions went. Let's begin with Spain, which of course was the one we were really looking at very closely. There was a five-year bond auction and they were looking to raise nearly $4 billion. The yield was at 4.54 percent. Now that is nearly 1 percentage point higher than last time around. But the good point is, of course, is that the market had been even fearing that the number would over 5 percent. If you look at the bid to cover that, the number of times it was oversubscribed. At two to one there was plenty of activity. Lots of demand for what Spain had to offer. Now, Italy is bid to cover was slightly less, although they did get the bond auction away; $4 billion of five-year bonds. In Italy's case the average yield was 3.67 percent, just up a tad on what they had to pay back in November. The $4 billion of 15-year bonds averaged 5 percent. In both cases the bid to cover ratio is 1.4 percent. And that is really very important. It means there was appetite for risk and at these sorts of levels that risk was manageable for both government and investors alike. So look at how the market reacted. Well, you don't need to be an investor genius to see Spain absolutely loved the IBEX rising, 2.6 percent. In Italy, slightly more muted. Portugal, of course, which go theirs away yesterday, that was just up a third of 1 percent. The euro did enjoy some in gains. It put on more than 1.75 percent against the dollar, at $1.33. So $1.30 has been and gone, and now comfortably into that higher range. There were other matters of course, as a result of what took place. The German finance minister, Wolfgang Shauble, says the states are working on a comprehensive package to solve the debt crisis. And that could be in place by March. Shauble doesn't think any increase in the Europe's emergency bailout fund, the Stability Fund, as you and I know it, is needed. But, of course, that would mean more German money.

There has been some genuinely good news as well, because in <FACT> the EFSF <SEEMS> to be building out its scope a bit. It is being buttressed.

There's new concern this morning about ISIS. Attacks by U.S. soil by ISIS-inspired terrorists. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security are warning law enforcement personnel and the news media that they could be targeted by ISIS militants. Law enforcement officials tell CNN that a security bulletin with the warning is based on chatter and extremist forums and on social media. It's not on any specific threat. It is based on chatter. In Iraq, ISIS is advancing on Baghdad, despite further airstrikes over the weekend by the U.S.-led coalition. More than 30 suspected ISIS fighters in Iraq were killed in an air strike Saturday, on an armed convoy west of Ramadi. But officials say ISIS is moving aggressively, dispatching as many as 10,000 fighters to Anbar province from Syria and from Mosul. Standing by live in Baghdad this morning, senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman. Ben, you know, Anbar is very close to Baghdad. Do these moves by ISIS represent a serious threat to the capital?",

So, the focus of their efforts up until now has not been so much the area <AROUND> Baghdad, although they are out there and they do occasionally make hit-and-run attacks on the defensive perimeter to the west of the city. But really, their focus is on towns like Ramadi, where yesterday the police chief was killed for the entire -- the police chief for an entire province was killed in a roadside bombing; in other towns along the Euphrates River, where they clearly want to get a foothold. But Baghdad itself, at the moment, is <WELL>-defended according to U.S. officials. There is a problem, of course, of frequent car bombs. There is a car bomb at least one every day at the capital. In <FACT>, on Saturday night there were two that killed more than 40 people. So, the concern of the Iraqi security officials itself has more to do with the threat of these car bombs presumably from ISIS within the city and not so much as these occasional probing attacks on this city's defense -- Christine."

The commission wants Rice to testify publicly, which the White House has refused to allow. Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat warned that the U.S. veto of a U.N. Security Counsel resolution <COULD> be a green light to Israel to carry out more assassinations. The U.S. was the sole vote yesterday against a measure condemning Monday's assassination by Israel of Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin. The U.S. says that it vetoed the resolution because it failed to condemn Hamas for terrorist attacks against Israel. Jurors in the Tyco case are back in the jury room at this hour, with the threat of a mistrial now hanging over the court. Jurors were sent home yesterday after complaining of a poisonous atmosphere in the jury room, <APPARENTLY> due to a single juror. Former Tyco executives Dennis Koslowski and Mark Schwartz are accused of plundering Tyco more than $60 million. And in Bridgeport, Connecticut demolition crews today will begin tearing down a badly burned section of Interstate 95. Intense heat from thousands of gallons of blazing fuel nearly melted the new overpass, caused by the spectacular crash of a tanker truck. The basic repairs will take at least 10 days, but it could be much long if engineering determine the entire overpass <MUST> be rebuilt. We are going to begin this hour at the White House and the election year minefield of the 9/11 investigations. The Bush administration is offering to have National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice <APPEAR> before the 9/11 Commission again.

I do <THINK>, on the plus side, what the administration is riding here is, at a time of a massive stock market rally, and high corporate profits, the corporations are going to stand to benefit a great deal here. And that will, you know, create favorable economic conditions overall. But once you start to dissect who's actually going to benefit over a period of time, I think it starts to break down. But Republicans have made this bet. They've made an argument. It's striking how many the differences as we've talked about over the last couple of weeks, with even the Bush tax cut in 2001 in terms of how many more people who are the top earners in the country benefit, as opposed to the middle class over time. But Republicans are going to notch a victory here and face voters with it next year. Mitch McConnell is on record now as saying that the effects of the tax cut will be immediate.

Kim Jong-un has a team of people who is so focused is the Korean peninsula politics nuclear gamesmanship. Who Trump has briefing him preparing him for the summit is less clear. But they can't do any of that until they decide on where they're going to hold it. And it seems like a simple thing, but in fact, if you start to really think about the political implications in meeting places. Let's say Kim Jong-un wants to go to Washington or he ruled that out, you know, going to U.S. territory. No. Donald Trump ruled out going to Pyongyang. For similar reasons, he doesn't feel that security could be guaranteed there. You know, Kim Jong-un ruled out going to an aircraft carrier on the waters of the Korean peninsula. Donald Trump ruled out going to the demilitarized zone. So where does that leave us? It leaves us with trying to find a neutral location for this and there are several places in Asia that are being thrown around as possibility. Singapore and Malaysia as you see on the screen there, or also going Vietnam, Thailand also a neutral European capital like Stockholm, Sweden, Geneva, Switzerland. Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia was considered a frontrunner a few days ago. That apparently is becoming less likely possibly just because of the logistics of getting all of the international press into that country. But some of the other issues are here that Kim Jong-un apparently prefers to travel by train, much like his predecessors. He took that armored train, that luxury train to Beijing. Obviously that limits where he'd be able to go. And if he's going to fly somewhere will his jet have the fuel capacity to get in there or will he have to get a jet from another country. So, all of those logistics are being work out, and then denuclearization what is it mean for North Korea. Well, it means the American nuclear umbrella going away, it means American troops off the Korean peninsula. It means a peace treaty with South Korea. Whereas, denuclearization for the United States means North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons completely in exchange for relief from economic sanctions, normalization of relations. Two very different definitions of the term. Are they going to be able to come together, we don't know. We certainly don't know if they are going to be able to come together in a location because they haven't chosen yet. And until they know where they are going to do it, they can set a date. Donald Trump saying early June, but also indicating that it might not happen, Rosemary.",

Now, on a weekend where you would think if they had any self- discipline, the Iranians would have played meek, nice, civilized, three examples. The foreign minister says we have won the right to enrich. Remember, every single U.N. Security Council resolution said they had to quit enriching. They now interpret the agreement as we've won the right to enrich. Second, President Rouhani, the so-called moderate, although he's hand- picked by the dictatorship, says this is a great victory for Iran, as you just suggested, Cliff, the sanctions wall will collapse. The most amazing thing, in a regime which currently has an American pastor locked up for a year for preaching Christianity, in a regime which just arrested a whole group of people for having had communion, I mean, a deliberately vicious regime in many ways, you have the real dictator, Khamenei, saying over the weekend in a speech that the Israelis are rabid dogs, the Americans are our enemies.

The approach of just pursuing sanctions and <ABSOLUTELY> no diplomacy has seen the Iranian nuclear program go from 164 centrifuges to 19,000 centrifuges. <CLEARLY> not a successful track record. This deal, for the first time ever since 2003, freezes the nuclear program, and part of the reason why it cannot be a repeat of what happened in North Korea is because, within the next six months, they're going to eliminate their stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium. As long as they don't have 20 percent enriched uranium, as long as they can't go back to 20 percent, they cannot build a bomb."

        "statement": "It is getting tighter and tighter and tighter, Kristie. And I tell you, it is so exciting what's going on here. You mentioned our CNN poll which came out about 24 hours ago. And that made a lot of news, because it indicated the race here in South Carolina <DEFINITELY> tightening up. Well, just in the last three hours two brand new polls of people who are likely to vote in the South Carolina Republican primary here. And one of them, take a look at this, this is by Politico. And right there are the top, there's Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. But you can see his advantage, his lead over Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker just 7 points. We're down to single digits in this brand new poll. This poll was conducted yesterday, that's Wednesday and Tuesday. So it was conducted entirely after Monday night's Republican presidential debate here in South Carolina where most pundits agreed Newt Gingrich had a very, very good night and Mitt Romney was on the defensive, especially over the taxes he pays and what the percentage is and if he would release his taxes, his income tax report. So another poll out this morning, Kristie, illustrating what's going on here also was conducted half before and after that debate. Before that debate, Romney had a 15 point advantage over Gingrich, after the debate down to 5. The polls are indicating, all of them, it's getting tighter, it's getting closer here. And <OF COURSE>, just about 12 hours from now right behind me here, this is the North Charleston Coliseum. This is where the CNN Southern Republican debate will be held. The last showdown for these five major Republican presidential candidates before Saturday's primary -- Kristie."

And as of right now Russia is very clear on its position. Syrian state media citing a joint statement for Moscow and Tehran saying quote \"we will respond strongly to any aggression on Syria. Russia and Iran will not allow America to dominate the world.\" That warning comes as the Trump administration tackles yet another potential threat, North Korea. Right now an aircraft carrier led strike group is deploying toward the Korean peninsula. A U.S. official confirms to CNN this is move is in a direct response to recent North Korean provocations. Meanwhile, as the White House tries to navigate all kinds of mine fields, the national security council, the very people who are helping to advise the president is seeing another shakeup. K.T. McFarland is leaving just days after chief strategist Steve Bannon was booted from the NSC. The impact it could have still unclear. CNN is covering this that only CNN can. We have a team of reporters and analysts standing by.

Clarissa, how are Syria and its allies now responding?",

Now, this was always the argument that the Obama administration had given for not intervening more forcefully or militarily inside Syria. That <PERHAPS> in doing so it <COULD> precipitate or escalate an actual clash between U.S. forces and Russian forces potentially leading to some <KIND OF> a global conflict or a World War III. That would be a worst case scenario. But at this stage, we still don't really <KNOW> exactly what Trump's policy in Syria is going to look like. We have seen some glimpses of it today hearing from U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley who said Assad is <DEFINITELY> one of our priorities in the sense that he <SHOULD> go. Hearing frankly different message from secretary state Tillerson that our priority fundamentally is the fight against ISIS. And of course the concern from some is that it's difficult to engage in that fight against ISIS without some fundamental level of cooperation with the Russians. A very complex situation in Syria. A lot of very nuanced issues to be taken into account. And these are exactly the sorts of issues that secretary of state Rex Tillerson and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov will be hashing out later this week -- Ana."

And there are heated debates already about the <BEST> way to proceed when it comes to things like bailouts and spending programs and tax cuts, et cetera. Then there are the wars. Pull out of Iraq, step it up in Afghanistan sounds good, right? What if Iran comes into Iraq through one door as we're leaving through another? We haven't been attacked in seven-and-a-half years, but terrorism is still a <FACT> of life. Global warming, health insurance, pick something you like. Nevertheless, the new president's off to a good start, and this time we <APPEAR> to be in the hands of someone less inclined to shoot from the hip.

Another person said the Iraqi insurgents will not be affected by this, because they weren't fighting for Saddam Hussein. They were fighting, they say, for Iraq, because they believe they see Iraq as being occupied, and they want to drive out the U.S.-led coalition. They say they're the occupying force here; they want to drive them out of Iraq. And that's the message that's been spoken to us this afternoon. We didn't see any signs of celebration on the streets here. That doesn't mean to say that there aren't people quietly in their houses very happy that Saddam Hussein has finally been captured. That was certainly the view of General Odierno, whose 4th Infantry Division patrols this area. He said that quietly, behind the scenes, he thought there would be some relief. But he was very realistic about the way the situation was going to play out in the next few days, weeks and months ahead. He said we'll literally have to wait and see whether or not this leads to further captures of Iraqi anti- coalition forces, whether or not it leads to an increase in attacks by the anti-coalition forces. So expectations, this side here in Iraq, as well, being played down by the coalition leadership, recognizing that Tikrit and perhaps some of the other towns in this area are special cases. Tikrit in particular, Wolf, being Saddam Hussein's former hometown, people here benefited from Saddam Hussein's regime. This town had better electricity, better buildings, better schools, better medical care, had these palaces. I'm talking to you from one of the palaces now. So perhaps that's why on the streets of Tikrit we really don't see anything akin to those celebrations in Baghdad, Wolf.",

And, Nic Robertson, we got some incredibly informative details from the military briefing that you attended there in Tikrit from the troops on the ground who conducted this raid. They had information Saddam Hussein was there, and they found it. Very briefly, just walk through some of the highlights, how they did it. Because, as you and our viewers <KNOW>, there were so many false alarms in the past."

        "statement": "Thanks for the question. That was on <OBVIOUSLY> on people's minds when I went down to New Orleans and Mississippi. The lessons of Katrina are very important. We've learned a lot here at the federal level: One, there needs to be better coordination between local and state government; secondly, that there needs to be a communications package that will be available to help deal with the situation that happened last time, which was total destruction of communications capabilities; third, that there needs to make <SURE> that there's a law enforcement alternative in case there's a breakdown of local law enforcement; fourthly, there needs to be a prepositioning of assets so that if a major storm were to come, we'd be able to move equipment in faster. But, most important, there needs to be a coordination and an understanding of the evacuation and relief plans. And I talked to the mayor and both governors that I met with yesterday about our seriousness in working with them to make sure that the plans are as effective as possible. The communications, obviously, this time <AROUND> are a lot better than last time around. And so the lessons are being learned. And my attitude toward the recommendations by Fran Townsend, who's a part of my administration, or the Congress, is we ought to take them all seriously. The objective is to respond to these natural disasters as well as we <POSSIBLY> can. The other issue down there for New Orleans, <OF COURSE>, is the levees. And we've got money in the supp to make sure that these levees are pre-Katrina or better prior to June 1st. I <THINK> we'll achieve that objective. There's -- additional money will be spent so that the levees are improved significantly by September of '07. The levees are important to -- the rebuilding of the levees or improving of the levees are very important to assure the people of New Orleans that if there is a storm, they're built to pre-Katrina levels, at least in the initial stage. But also it's important to convince people that it's OK to risk capital in New Orleans. The amazing thing in the area down there -- I don't <KNOW> if you all went with me, but it was -- there's -- it's a <TOTALLY> different attitude from when we were there before early on, obviously, after the storm. I mean, people are coming back. The sales tax along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi are higher today than they were a year ago this date and that's positive. But, look, there's still a lot of work to be done, a lot of reconstruction. The CDBG money -- and it's very important for the Congress to pass the CDBG money I requested so that the housing issue can get -- people can get back to rebuilding their homes. And Mississippi, the CDBG money will be coming out pretty quick. New Orleans, they still got a little work. The governor has proposed a plan that will be in front of the legislature I think this weekend. It's a very important step to getting this process moving. And so we've got a lot of work to do. But, yes, we're much more ready this time than last time and we're taking very seriously the lessons learned from Katrina."

The Trump administration defends the alleged effort by Jared Kushner to set up secret backchannel links with the Russians, calling that normal and acceptable, but a former CIA director calls it off the map; and Democrats are calling for a review of the security clearance for the president's son-in-law. Broken trust. After meeting with President Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel says Europe can no longer completely rely on others; and Germany's foreign minister says President Trump's actions have put Europe's peace at risk. Is a crucial alliance on rocks? Democratic terrorism? Domestic terrorism. The FBI is investigating a violent attack on a commuter train after two men are killed trying to stop a man yelling anti-Muslim slurs at two young women. The president tweets that the victim stood up to hate and intolerance. Was this a hate crime and domestic terrorism? And catastrophic war. North Korea launches its third missile in three weeks as Defense Secretary James Mattis warns a conflict with North Korea could be catastrophic. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. President Trump honors America's fallen on this Memorial Day, laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns and visiting the graves of service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. But as the commander in chief considers boosting America's battle against terrorism, the White House is now on the defensive amid growing questions about contacts with Russia, including what sources say was an effort by the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to set up a pre-inauguration secret backchannel link to Russia. While a former CIA director finds that move appalling, homeland security secretary John Kelly says it's no big deal. Sources say the White House is preparing a war room to combat the growing number of allegations and leaks as multiple Russia investigations gather momentum. And new controversies are arising from the president's recent overseas trip. After meetings dominated by friction with President Trump over climate, trade and defense, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, says Europeans must, quote, \"take our fate into our own hands,\" while her foreign minister says President Trump's actions are putting Europe's peace at risk. I'll talk to Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego, an Iraq War veteran. He's on the Armed Services Committee. And our correspondents, specialists and guests, they're standing by with full coverage of the day's top stories. President Trump's son-in-law is the lightning rod as a new storm batters the White House. Top officials are rushing to downplay allegations that Jared Kushner wanted to establish a secret link to Russia back during the transition. Let's begin with CNN's Diane Gallagher. Diane, what are you learning?",
        "statement": "Yes, <WELL>, Wolf this <MAY> have actually been the reason that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump cut their portion of the overseas trip short.

And there is a weather warning in effect for shipping off the coast of northeastern China due to thick sea ice. Mari Ramos has more, she joins us now from the world weather center -- Mari.",
        "statement": "Hey, Kristie. Good to see you. You <KNOW> what, sometimes -- well, you know, this time of year you'd expect to see sea ice, right, in many areas across northeastern China. The thing is that this time <AROUND> we're talking about some of the thickest in <QUITE> a long time. Let's go ahead and look at the pictures first of all, and then I'll show you which part of the world we're talking about. So this is an (inaudible) in Lazhou Bay in eastern China, just near Shandong Province. And just off the water here you can see how thick the ice actually is. Well, this is a problem, particularly for shipping because <OF COURSE> both cannot get in and out of the harbor. There are hundreds of boats that are literally stuck in that very thick ice and some of those boats can be permanently damaged because of the ice. Now one of the questions that comes up -- there you see the boats stuck in the ice -- that comes up often is also fishing. What happens with the fishing industry? Well, there's a lot of areas there for fishing that -- where they have fish farms, for example. Well, most of the farmers had actually finished their harvest already this year. Usually they finish that by the end of December. So they don't <THINK> that those areas will be affected. But, you know, you can see it there, pretty significant. Come back over to the weather map. This is a very busy area across northeastern China. We're talking in that northwestern corner of the Yellow Sea, in the Bohai Sea. And right over here you can actually see it on this visible satellite image from NASA the extent of the thick ice, in some cases over 125 kilometers. This is not the thickest that they've ever measures, or the widest that they've ever measured. They actually had more ice back in 2010. So this is the second time in two years where we have something so significant. And you guys in Beijing and Seoul, you know what I'm talking about. But it has been so cold over the last couple of weeks. And that of course has helped create that sea ice that you see there. Minus 4 now in Tokyo. The situation in Japan is going to be more snowfall on the way for you after all the snow that you had over the weekend, also very strong winds expected here as another push of cold air continues to move across the northeastern portion of the continent. This is what it looks like on the satellite as you can see here. Another area I want to talk to you about is as we head farther to the south, this is Indonesia. Over the weekend reports coming out of this area, particularly near Jakarta, of some very heavy rain. Well, this rain I don't think it's really associated to Tropical Cyclone Iggy, that storm is way down here to the south nearing the coast of Australia. However, this time of year we are talking about the wettest time of the year here across this part of world, anywhere from Papua New Guinea, which we had landslides last week, back over toward Indonesia of course, and peninsular parts of Malaysia. So <DEFINITELY> something to monitor. The other thing is, of course, is our Tropical Cyclone Iggy right here off the coast of Australia. Even though high waves have been a concern and even some scattered showers, the center of the storm itself is expected to stay out at sea and not have a direct impact here on this western coast of Australia. I want to switch gears completely and give you a brief update on what's happening in Europe, because this is also another big story, a lot going on. The heavy snowfalls across eastern Europe finally coming to an end. You look at the snow banks, Kristie, in some cases several meters high here. The snow coming to an end, but that Arctic high pressure will spread that cold air all the way into western Europe -- London, even today you were struggling to get out of freezing. Paris, you <MIGHT> not even get out of freezing over the next couple of days. Back to you."

Three lawmakers have filed a measure that would eliminate the part of state law that now explicitly prohibits gay marriage. Women in the U.S. military can expect new roles placing them even closer to the combat zone. The defense department said that possibility will occur when it opens up nearly 14,000 new jobs to military women. Right now, women are restricted from serving in small ground units involved in combat. So, for the past decade, many have served in support positions that have put them in harm's way anyway. Some of the new jobs include tank or artillery mechanics, field surgeons in forward position, and crew members on missile launchers. A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by the animal rights group PETA that SeaWorld was enslaving killer whales for human amusement. The judge ruled the 13th Amendment that prohibits slavery does not apply to non-humans. The judge called slavery an involuntary servitude uniquely human activities. SeaWorld says the lawsuit was a baseless publicity stunt, but PETA says it will pursue other avenues to help SeaWorld's five killer whales. The U.N. is calling it appalling brutality.

At the moment it's not entirely <CLEAR> whether one or more attackers is still on the loose in the Taj Mahal Hotel, a Mumbai landmark. The standoff at the nearby Oberoi Hotel ended with the killing of two attackers and the rescue of surviving guests and employees. Thirty dead bodies have been recovered from the Oberoi to date, and the siege of the Chabad House ended with the deaths of at least two attackers and five hostages, including the rabbi and his wife, as we just mentioned. Well, this assault on Mumbai has proven a tactical challenge for police and military forces. Sprawling hotels to clear, innocent civilian hostages and gunmen with itchy trigger fingers."

My kids are a little bit older than Vivek's. Mine are going to be in 10th, eighth, and sixth grades. And I think we'll start to get a little bit more granular about very young kids versus high school kids versus college kids. I do think there's differences in terms of the likelihood of getting sick, the likelihood of spread. If you start looking at contact tracing studies, for example, from other countries, you do find that the risk of transmissibility is lower among kids to themselves and to older people. But it's not zero. The thing that strikes me about this is that if you look at the studies, what is the impact overall of shutting down schools? How much of an impact does that make on society? And they say it's about two percent to four percent according to some of these studies in terms of reduction of the spread, the reduction of hospitalizations and deaths. If you're in a place where you're already having thousands of new people get infected every day, two to four percent of that is a large number. That's the thing. If you had a smaller number of new infections or if the cases were at least going in a downward trend like where you guys are up in New York, I think it would be a much better situation. Where I'm here in Georgia, where Vivek, I think you're still in Florida, it's a tougher sort of thing to ascertain. I don't know. We'll see over the next several weeks, but unless the numbers go in the right direction, I think it's going to be tough for the schools to reopen in any kind of normal way.",

The other thing is that -- you shouldn`t forget that along the graph that you`ve just shown of arrests on the U.S./Mexico border, Mexico in the first six months of 2019 has also been doing an important part of this, which is deporting back to Central American countries almost 75,000 central American migrants. So, Mexico has not been sitting on its hands either. The problem is, Christiane, you can`t enforce your way out of a migration crisis. This is going to take time, it`s going to take commitment, it`s going to take resources, and it`s going to take addressing some of the drivers of these transmigration trends from Central America into Mexico and on their way to the United States, mainly public insecurity and some of the effects of the draw up per the climate change patterns that are hitting rural parts of the Northern Triangle countries, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which is <SORT OF> driving a combination of urban migration, fleeing and security, and rural migration, fleeing lack of economic opportunities."

And he remains at the moment, according to world polls, the most popular political figure in the world right now. So we will <CERTAINLY> see a big response when he comes out shortly for his final goodbye there. We will be waiting for that. We will go to that immediately when it comes up. I see a crowd moving right now. Let's pause for one more moment and listen here and see if by chance he is coming out right now. And it looks like that is a no. We'll check back in a moment. In the meantime, let's look at some of the other news that is happening internationally. There is an offer from Pakistan to help the U.S. negotiate with the Taliban, yes, negotiate with the Taliban. That's the offer. A top military officer says Pakistan can set up direct talks with the top Taliban leader in Afghanistan. Our Michael Ware has more on this story from Baghdad, including some of the reaction from U.S. officials."

So Donald Trump brought that message into liberal urban Chicago. It simply was not welcome there. Most of the places he campaigns across the country have loud adoring supporters, we've seen him across the south and other places. But this is like coming into the belly of the beast, the liberal beast. They simply did not want Donald Trump's message here. So I think that a lot of the response was just the chance for Chicago and the democrats here, there is a democratic primary going on to just say no, we don't want Donald Trump. So in a sense it was a preview of what <COULD> be a general election contest. I mean, if Donald Trump <THINKS> that he can make Illinois competitive, if he thinks he can make Michigan competitive <SHOULD> he become the nominee this is what we could see. But I was struck just the earnestness of the protest. We talked to one demonstrator, one man who lived in the neighborhood where this rally was supposed to be going on. And this is why he said he came out to protest."

Wall Street's winning streak has come to an end. The Dow briefly had an intraday high and then it fell back -- very briefly. Look at it. Right at the beginning of the day. A smidgeon of green on the top left of your screen. Things turned thereafter. It was off 53 points, ending nine straight days of gains and seven days of record closures. The S&P and Nasdaq both closed slightly lower, as well. Let's put this into context. The Dow is still up 30 percent for the year and is closed at a record of 42 times since the beginning of the year. The IMF's managing director says she's worried about complacency as markets hit record after record and economies enjoy steady growth. Christine Lagarde is warning there's a whole generation that is yet to experience a serious market correction.

And now Donald Trump Jr. agreeing to sit down to be questioned. Of course, the question going forward is, what is the line of inquiry here? Are they concerned that he was not truthful before the committee when he appeared weeks ago? Is it possible they want to test his statements to see if he committed perjury then? Of course, the other question is, what more do they want to learn about what was a central part of the Russia investigation? And that is that Trump Tower meeting in June 2016, where he was interested and the campaign was interested in receiving foreign help, dirt on Hillary Clinton, from Russia. Yes, the special counsel concluded that there was no conspiracy between the two sides but it did cite a number of instances, like this one, to speak to contacts and interests and, as the special counsel said, you'll remember in that report, that there was interest from the Trump campaign in receiving that help.

Other authorities from other countries involved in the investigation have also thrown out a bit of information. This latest information coming from Malaysian authorities that are showing two different routes that potentially this plane may have taken. It may have gone north or may have gone south into the southern portion of the Indian Ocean. Let's talk about Kazakhstan. You are familiar with that region and how mountainous it is. If that plane were to have enough fuel to get there intentionally, if it were able to land in the general region, what would this mean based on some of the sources you have and people you talked to? What would this potentially mean that this plane would have some intention possibly to go to that region?",
        "statement": "Yes, it's really -- Fred, I have to say a lot of speculation at the moment. One would imagine if a group had taken a plane lot of people hostage, there would be demands for the release of these people. Would it be a group and there is no basis for us to be at the support. Would they be trying to extort something? What we <KNOW> about the track or at least the <BEST> estimate that they would have gone from Northern Thailand and Miramar and across the west of China to the plateau across the desert through the Turkestan's airspace and on to Kazakhstan's airspace. Where it is on the track is <KIND OF> what's interesting partly about this track that it flew. They <THOUGHT> it <MAY> have flown across western chine. China, one would expect them through the radar system to be able to pick up unidentified aircraft and respond to it. It would have intersected with what was a hijacking a year and a half ago in December of 2012. It was blamed on Uighurs on a flight flying across that western bit of China. Again, it's hard to get substantial details. There is a Uighur community and tensions between the north and the south between the ethnic groups. A very mountainous country for <SURE>. The places to land the planes would be tough. Kazakhstan may be easier to land an aircraft there, but again a government that substantially had resources and you expect them to have a long reach in terms of radar or know what's going on there."

        "statement": "Oh, I'm not <SURE> I can make sense out of it. But, you <KNOW>, where this really began was in Europe. And that was the biggest problem, because there was a report out this morning, earlier today, <OBVIOUSLY>, that said that the European banks <MAY> not be able to fund their U.S. obligation. And that sent shivers pretty much through the financial sector all across the board. European banking shares sinking. American banking shares doing the same thing. You've got Citigroup down today, I <THINK> it we are about 6 percent. You've got Wells Fargo off 4.5 percent, JPMorgan Chase down 3.75 percent. And then it just continued. There was a report from Morgan Stanley describing the <FACT> that we are at the brink of a global recession. And that again sent shivers through the marketplace, because what this has done is turned speculation. You know, Max, we've been talking about this possibility pretty much the last couple of months. But now it's turning into a reality. And that's the problem. The other <SORT OF> rumor that I heard very earlier on in today's session from one of the hedge fund guys that I talk to all the time was that a regional bank stepped up to the ECB and asked for a $500 million loan. The reason that's important is because in banking terms, that's not a tremendous amount of money. And if that's what they need to keep solvent, that's of great concern to the marketplace, because who's next, <POSSIBLY>? And then in the United States, we got a rash of economic information all pointing to the down side, whether it was an increase in jobless claims, a regional report on manufacturing that was horrendous, frankly, and also consumer inflation kicking up ever so slightly and existing home sales down 3.5 percent. You've got all sectors there pointing to the down side. And that's what put fear into the marketplace. But what's interesting is people did step in at the end of the day and sort of -- that's what they call bottom fishing, looking for good prices for stocks. So that's actually a good sign that there are buyers out there in the marketplace. There's plenty of cash on the sidelines. But we had some bad news, also, at the bread -- at the end of the day, at the -- at the close, coming from Hewlett-Packard, now saying that they're not going to be selling PCs. They've -- they're not going to be selling their touch pad anymore. They cut their sales <VIEW> and that stock was down about 7 percent right at the -- at the word of that news. But again, you know, all that glitters is gold. People have stepped into the marketplace and picked up gold once again. It's up $34 right now, at $1,828. The guys I talked to were looking for $2,000 in the near term, which, frankly, is <QUITE> amazing. Also, one other bit of news that was a little frightening in the marketplace is that a Swedish financial regulator stepped in to scrutinize the U.S. operations of -- of the European's largest lenders and said it won't take much for inter-bank lending to freeze. That is <CERTAINLY> not anything that any of us want to hear in the near-term. So, Max, it was a very volatile day. It will <PROBABLY> continue into the weekend, as people may not want to hold onto their positions in Friday's trading."

He said that that is really breaking apart in New Jersey's middle class. You look at the Conservative Heritage Foundation, and they say the majority of jobs lost over the past 30 years have been union jobs. But one last point, a labor economist I talked to this morning says this goes beyond the money, Kyra. This goes to worker satisfaction, safety in the workplace and it's not just about the money.

Again, please stay safe. If that wasn't enough now, I want to get you some more information about just how big these fissures are, how close they are to home, the kind of danger they pose. Meteorologist Tom Sater is joining us from CNN headquarters in Atlanta for more on that. Tom, help us out.",
        "statement": "All right. Let's break it all down, Ana, because it's <QUITE> massive really in its scope here. This is the main chamber. OK. Kilauea, we've seen <OF COURSE> the plumes. The fissures that are opening up are releasing this energy from underground are good 20, 25 miles away., So the lava that was in the main chamber has been draining. It's been making its way underground for that 20 or 25 miles. So let's break this down, too. Each time we have one or what's leading up to these are the tremors. We've had hundreds of them. Many <AROUND> the summit and then on the east rift. And this is where the fissures have been opening up. Now we <THOUGHT> we had number 18 today. Hawaii Volcano Observatory said no, it's just 17. Because officially to have a fissure it needs to emit lava. So you can have the smoke, you can have the pressure and the gas. But it needs to emit lava. This is Leilani Estate. These are where the homes are. Notice we've got evacuation zones, we've got road closures. The green triangles are all the fissures. Now over the weekend and last week, there was no rhyme or reason to them. We've had a couple on Thursday that were to the southwest and a couple of more to the northeast. But these weekends have been the furthest to the east that we have seen which tells you that this is traveling underground until it gives. So as this lava is released, it is draining the main chamber. That's important to <KNOW> here. Take a look at this imagery that we've got from the USGS. It's a camera that looks down into the caldera. As the lava drops, which was at the top, it releases pressure so there's like landslides. There's debris that falling inside. Here is the lava on April 23rd. Now this is important because there is a fear that we <COULD> have a steam driven, massive, violent eruption if this lava drops all the way down to the water table which is at 1500 feet. Right now the lava is down almost 1200. A couple of feet a day. Another near little 3D imagery, technology is amazing here. From the USGS. they can tell us from using their high-tech cameras what this caldera or this chamber is actually shaped like. And it's getting down and tapering at the end which means debris is coming down which is going to cause pressure but it's also like packing a cannon. And when this thing goes, it's going to blow. Let's take a look another 3D area and you'll get an idea of exactly what we've been watching. So as the fissures again release the magma, we'll see the magma in the main chamber drop. If it gets down to this water level here, with all that debris inside, it doesn't mean it's going to happen but the elements are there. And if they interact just perfectly, this is where a massive eruption could occur like it did in 1924 where you had boulders that were eight tons, you know, size of a car, to 14 tons. Ana, that's like a semi tractor trailer truck that were blown a good half mile to even a mile away. So it's dropping quickly. It's a big concern. The more fissures that are expected, which will most likely happen, will drain more of that lava from the main caldera or that main chamber. So it's a little frightening but the tremors are going to continue to occur as this activity continues."

Now, all along, Carol, there had been two major issues crippling this process, the role of religion and the notion of federalism. On the former, we're told an agreement has been reached in principle. The head of Iraq's National Assembly telling me earlier that Islam will be \"a main source of Iraqi legislation.\" That will raise concerns among women's rights groups, who had hoped Islam would simply \"a\" source, one of many, something they felt was necessary to ensure their rights. It will also raise questions about role, how prominent a role religious clerics will play in the new Iraq. But that other issue, federalism, is emerging as an impasse. The Kurds want explicit reference to it in the constitution, maintaining an autonomous region in the north. The Sunnis want all talk of federalism sidelined until a new government comes into power. And the Shia are perhaps split. Some of them are calling for an autonomous region in the country's south. Others are calling for a unified, single Iraq.

And he said interesting that he <THOUGHT> the recovery was now under way in the Shanghai market. Which inn the same breath he's talking about market reforms. Now he's <SORT OF> -- he's making calls on where the market <MAY> go. I thought that was <QUITE> interesting. But the third point is the currency. That's also caused a huge amount of concern worldwide. There was a devaluation of the Chinese Yuan after the authorities let it be more focused on market forces. The Yuan has fallen. He is now saying that it is at a fair value, about 3% lower than it was, that's also key. Now whether it stays that way remains to be seen. He's talking about market forces, reforms. Whether China will let the market forces decide on where the Yuan goes, where the stock markets go from will be interesting. It'll be deeds and not words which he'll be judged by."

Nasrallah said no army, quote, \"In the world could disarm Hezbollah.\" This was a day of mass celebration for Hezbollah's legions of Muslim Shia supporters. It was also an occasion when Hezbollah leader really laid down the law as far as he's concerned about the future of Lebanon. He says he wants to see the current pro-U.S.-backed government, led by Prime Minister Fouad Siniora to step down and to make way for a new unity government that will be more pro-Syrian, and in effect close to Iran, Hezbollah's main supporter in terms of money and logistics. Now, this was Hassan Nasrallah appearing not without risk, he said, even some 30 minutes before he appeared, he said he was arguing with his own security advisers about whether or not he should appear in public. In the end he was on display throwing out rhetoric against Israel, against the United States, for more than an hour. \"A very important day,\" he said, \"A historic day, a day in which all Lebanese could celebrate what he called a divine victory over Israel.\"",

In the process of reaching out to the world's 1.5 billion Muslims with today's speech, it's unclear if President Obama, in the process, was also pushing away America's longtime ally, Israel. Speaking in Cairo, the president recognized the U.S.' \"unbreakable bond\" with the Jewish state and the horror of the Holocaust, but he also talked about the suffering of the Palestinian people. He described their situation as intolerable, and he stressed the need for a two-state solution. President Obama called on Palestinians to abandon violence, pointing to America's own civil rights history and saying that it was a peaceful and determined insistence that brought about equal rights for African-Americans. And he once again called upon Israel to stop building the settlements and to allow Palestinians to live and work and develop their own society. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already rejected President Obama's call for a freeze on those settlements, but experts suggest that this demand from Mr. Obama will make the Arab world listen. They say although the U.S. has been opposed to Israeli settlements for decades, past American presidents have looked the other way and allowed Israel to just keep building them. And some believe that if \"no\" really means \"no\" this time around, well, it may be easier to form a regional coalition against Iran. And speaking of Iran, Mr. Obama repeated his belief today the Islamic republic has the right to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes. That's another statement that's probably not going to sit real well with the Israelis. And finally, for the first time in a long time, a visit to the Middle East by a sitting U.S. president did not include a stop in Israel. So here's the question: Is President Obama reaching out to Muslims at the expense of America's relationship with Israel? Go to cnn.com/caffertyfile and post a comment on my blog. Pretty big stuff.",

The Saudi foreign minister wants to talk to the president about the situation in Iraq, and it comes, as Ari Fleischer says, at a critical juncture in the region. One of the things the Saudis have been working on is a plan to try to get Saddam Hussein out of Iraq, to try to find a place for him to go into exile. The White House hasn't been very hopeful that this is a prospect that's really got any <KIND OF> a life to it, but Ari Fleischer did say today -- quote -- \"Suffice to say, if Saddam Hussein were to go into exile, that would be a very helpful event for the world.\" But he also noted that they are making plans, other plans -- and we <KNOW> what those plans are -- in the event he doesn't go into exile. Other meetings today, as you mentioned, a key meeting with the prime minister of Italy, that's Silvio Berlusconi. He was one of the signators to the letter signed by eight European leaders, signaling that they are in solidarity with the United States in dealing with Saddam Hussein. Tomorrow, he has another important meeting. He will meet with the British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has been really the U.S.'s number one ally in dealing with Iraq -- Fred."

You know, so it's really quite paradoxical that people are wringing their hands when we're running $160 billion surplus, that they don't think it's enough. I think it's really quite good that we're able to run $160 billion surplus when we have effectively zero growth in the economy or something close to that.

What is interesting here is that the European Union has called on these individual governments to launch their own investigations, mainly because they don't have the power to investigate further. It <SEEMS> highly <UNLIKELY> that any of these countries will do so. They will take cover under national security, saying that they won't be allowed to divulge this. There has been speculation that, in fact, a secret CIA prison was operating in both Poland and Romania. President Bush, back in September, admitted that these CIA prisons did exist. And, although they don't have any detainees in them right now, he wouldn't rule out the fact they would be used again in the future. This has really been an issue nagging at the European parliament. I <THINK> they don't want to have the taint of these kinds of secret clandestine transfers, interrogations, hanging over Europe. And so they have pushed this issue through to the parliament. As I said, there is <ABSOLUTELY> nothing that is legally binding about this. This issue, though, will continue to grind on in the European parliament. They expect to go through this report.

What that, <OF COURSE>, makes investigators concerned about is the possibility that there's another cell that's just as good.

With the insurgency roiling Iraq, the Bush administration is quick to blame Iran and Syria for destabilizing Iraq's young government. But today comes the word that nearly half the foreign fighters now terrorizing Iraq are actually from Saudi Arabia. Yes, that Saudi Arabia. The U.S. ally where 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers came from. The other country that's problematic, Pakistan. That country's president, Pervez Musharraf, <MAY> be indirectly helping Al Qaeda get its act together. Staying in Pakistan, and what is a major turn of events, Islamic fighters in a lawless region that borders Afghanistan have ended a truce with the government. Now, remember, Musharraf promised that he would be able to keep Al Qaeda in check, under control. But attacks in this region this weekend have killed at least 70 people, including Pakistani troops, as <WELL> as police officers. This truce has been the subject of a painful second-<GUESSING> game. U.S. officials are complaining that Musharraf's hands-off stance has made the region, Pakistan, an even bigger base now for Al Qaeda.

The Republicans are on record, all of them, that all of these tax cuts <SHOULD> be extended -- this is Obama's pound of flesh because he won the presidential election. He's the one insisting that taxes go up. They're going to take $500 billion out of savings in the United States over the next decade and give it to the federal government. This is not helpful to the economy, and it will hurt the economy. But remember Obama is not just raising taxes on the rich right now. We're about to enter a decade where a trillion-dollars is going to be taken away from the American people in higher taxes to pay for Obamacare. This was passed only by Democrats. It is entirely a Democrat tax increase. And it includes many taxes that directly hit middle income and lower income people. So Obama's tax increase is not just the top tax rates. It's people -- if you have bad health problems and you spend more than 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income on out-of- pocket health costs, you used to be able to deduct anything above that. Thanks to Obama's law, Obamacare, that's now 10 percent. So $2 million to $3 million will be taken out of people average income $53,000 a year, who are lower income, middle income and sick. They're going to be paying taxes for Obamacare. There's an avalanche of Obama tax increases coming next year."

That will make it probably difficult or impossible to sustain our presence in Syria. Iran will gain influence there. We have meanwhile changed the narrative in Iran and in Iraq. It was about Iranian regime failure, and now it's about American regime failure. The war against ISIS has been suspended. ISIS has been a great beneficiary of this. And we haven't even come to the real military response. Most people think that this was the official response, and that there will be continued actions by Iran, with some plausible deniability. And this is going to be, you know, what's going to happen -- the people who are most likely to get hurt aren't American soldiers on bases. And they're not members of the Quds force.

She doesn't have the virus. He's following all the appropriate advice, we're told. The tests were carried out in Scotland where he currently is by the Health Service. He met the criteria required for testing, which in this vulnerable group. Obviously, Alisyn, this raises concerns about who he has been in contact with as well, and our first concern, obviously, being the queen. So I've been speaking to Buckingham Palace and she wasn't in contact with him, recently on March 12, after an investiture. So that is a concern. She is following the appropriate advice with regard to her wealth. She's in her 90s after all. And we're told that she remains in good health. The palace won't be commenting any further on that. Obviously, we've bombarding them with questions about whether or not she's being tested, whether or not she has the virus. But if Prince Charles has taken testing based on government advice, and we can assume that she has, but we're not being given the results. But she does remain in good health. She's just down the road from where I am, Alisyn, at Windsor Castle, in a safe space. Prince Charles in a safe space up in Scotland. But what we're more concerned about whether was this meeting earlier in the month. Was he contagious? Did she catch it? Have other members of the family caught it as well?

What impresses me about Truman is the fact that unlike, you know, LBJ, who buys into the argument that Ho Chi Minh is somebody we can maybe get a better compromise with by over eagerly negotiating and so forth. Truman doesn't buy any of that with Stalin on day one. And he has no institutional knowledge which would lead him to this conclusion. It's pure instinct. And he's getting all sorts of advice from people pushing a Roosevelt agenda, people pushing their own agendas. And for somebody who's following the great FDR to be able to assert themselves so early on without neglecting the legacy of FDR during such an important moment in history, it's nothing short of extraordinary."

And there was a capacity to do that during the conduct of their operation, because there were competent battalion commanders. The battalion commander at Camp Arifjan was conducting his detention operation to standard. At Camp Buka, they did that at Camp Buka. And also at Camp Cropper.

We have many two- parent households in this country that it takes both families -- both of the parents working to keep the families out of poverty and with a good wage. This study, if you're just thinking about hours, we did not look at in this particular report what happens when you're putting -- subjecting children to living in poverty. And I think that's got to be part of the equation. The other thing that we have to look at is to know that, in fact, mothers are very important for children, but other social experiences also are important, opportunities to interact with other children, opportunities to interact with other adults, be that fathers, be that grandparents, and also child care providers. Children learn from these social experiences. Of course, the mother is important, but few people in this country believe that only the mother is important. We've had a long history of children going to nursery school. Very, very few children actually have experiences only with the mother. When I was a kindergarten teacher 25 years ago, the children that I actually worried about the most were children who had never been around other children or other caregivers.

We have important advice on jobs and how to hang on to the biggest investment of your life. YOUR BOTTOM LINE starts now. We'll get to your jobs in just a minute, but first, details of President Obama's foreclosure prevention program are now public. You can see them at hud.gov. Look under the tab that says \"Making Home Affordable.\" And here's the big picture, the plan has two initiatives. The first is for people underwater in their mortgage. Who qualifies? Well, if you are current, but can't refinance because of falling home prices, you could be in line for some help. The loan must be held by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Ask your lender. Now, what it does for you is it allows you to refinance into a loan with lower monthly payments or avoid a big fat rate reset. There's no principle reduction but you could save money over the life of your loan. Now, the second imitative is designed to help lower monthly payments for homeowners at risk of foreclosure. These loan modifications work by reducing interest rates. The new interest rate is in place for five years, after that it resets higher each and every year for five years. This program also includes a new provision that would eliminate borrower's second mortgages. Now, you qualify, if you're behind on mortgage payments. The mortgage must be for your primary home, it can't be an investment. The monthly mortgage bill must be more than 31 percent of your monthly gross income. To get ready, here's what you'll need: Put together the proof of your income, these are your W-2s, your most recent income tax return, second mortgage documents if you have it, credit card payment proof. This is critical and information on other loans including student loans, car loans, whatever you got. Now, whether or not you can afford your house is critical to your financial health, but so is your job, if you're lucky to have one these days. If you don't, or you're looking to trade up to a better job, you'll want to listen up. Jennifer Merritt is the career editor for the \"Wall Street Journal\" and Manisha Thakor is a personal finance expert and auditor of \"On My Own Two Feet.\" Great to see both of you guys. You know, there's a lot of conversation about the best places to go for jobs. And I think all of us have had the experience of sending out resumes to a million different places and nothing happens.

When you see a lot of lightning you <KNOW> we're talking about the severe thunderstorm cells developing. In <FACT>, for that reason, you can actually see the severe thunderstorm warnings. As one of these expires, another one shows up. Notice here look in the distance as one cell builds right behind the other. That's what we're starting to see this morning. So it looks like it's not letting up just yet. Currently these warning boxes not expire for at least another hour. What happens when you have a severe thunderstorm warning? Well, we're talking about strong winds. So keep in mind all the debris that's out there this morning, all of that is going to be blowing <AROUND>. Hail, they reported pebble-size hail. But <CERTAINLY> in a system like this, we're going to be talking about golf ball size hail and some of those strong winds. We <COULD> see gusts really <KIND OF> picking up. Now a lot of these systems 20 to 30 miles per hour unless, <OF COURSE>, don't forget the heavy rain with that. Of course, a lot of people don't have shelter this morning so a very tough situation for them. Not the only thing we're looking at. You can really tell the heavy amounts of rain out there. One of the things that I like to mention, people really underestimate the power of flooding. A lot of flooding could occur, six inches of water. That's all it takes to take a human life. Try and cross that flood water, that's all it takes. Two feet of water even a large SUV can be swept away. Number one reason for deaths in this country when it comes to weather is the flooding. When we see cells like this, we're very concerned. I want to show you also it not the only risk area today. Original low, the one that produced all of that mess over in the plains, that same low has made its way to the northeast. We do have a slight risk area for us as well. We're going to talk about strong winds, hail, and the heavy rain for us, isolated tornadoes. Not really the major threat here in the northeast, but once we go right back in towards Oklahoma and panhandle of Texas, not in the forecast. Not as high of a risk as what we saw a few days ago but still, like we're already seeing, the large hail, strong winds and heavy rain, in the forecast and here the threat is higher than in the northeast for certainly <POTENTIAL> here for an isolated tornado. Unfortunately, this forecast from mere is not just for today. As we go through Memorial Day weekend, showers will remain in the forecast. So hard, everyone is trying to get their lives together."

So certainly there is going to be some talk about why would she do something like that? And I just want people to realize that even though someone might assume the risk, like she might have done in this case, it's certainly not deserving if there is foul play involved. And I always go back to the case with the woman that was jogging in Central Park that night and was basically left for dead. Everybody said, how stupid can you be to go jogging at Central Park at night? It wasn't the smartest thing in the world but certainly she didn't deserve what happened. So I am sure they are keeping their hopes up. And I am sure they don't want to hear why would she get in a car, they just are <HOPING> and praying to God that she is alive.

The judge in this case, Lloyd Nash has said that he intends to appoint an independent counsel to come in and speak to Caldwell.

Earl Caldwell objected to that, so the exact person who will be chosen remains to be seen. The prosecution had also hoped in a separate motion to remove William Jordan, a private investigator who is assisting the defense team. He had helped Mr. Blake there the past on the custody issue involving Bonny Lee Bakley. The judge has denied that motion of the prosecution, so Jordan will stay on with the team.

        "previous_statement": "It's crunch time. CNN has \"The Best Political Team on Television\" ready to go for you this morning. We have White House correspondent Suzanne Malveaux, as well as chief political correspondent Candy Crowley, our chief national correspondent John King and our senior political editor Mark Preston. All of them will be reporting for us throughout the morning on the issues in this election that will certainly impact your future. We kick things off now with Suzanne. She's at the White House this morning. So I know they're all busy. They're all out there on the campaign trail. What is the strategy behind these final campaigning stops for the president this week?",
        "statement": "Well, Kiran, everybody's packing a bag because we're all going to be on the road for the next week or so. <OBVIOUSLY> the president, the first lady, the vice president. The strategy really is get these folks out to the polls. The people that are really going to make a difference here. Who are those folks? We're talking about female voters, African-American voters, young voters trying to build momentum in these next couple of days or so. The president very quickly going to Rhode Island for a fundraiser. But then he's really going to kick into high gear at the end of the week. That's when he goes to Bridgeport, Connecticut, as well as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania, you <KNOW>, very important state, leans Democratic. But there's an important Senate race there. Neither one of them incumbent. So it's really going to be an interesting test to see how does this whole thing with voter anger, frustration, unemployment play out in that particular state. He's then going to be traveling on to Chicago, Illinois. As we know, very important symbolically for the president because who is going to fill his Senate seat, the Senate seat that he once occupied? Quietly, White House officials tell us, look, you know, this is going to be important because you don't want to give the Republicans bragging rights if they end up capturing President Obama's old Senate seat. So they want to keep that Democratic. And then finally, he's heading off to Ohio. Very important governor's race there, as well as a couple of House seats that are on the line. And one of the things that you're going to see in Ohio is the whole issue of unemployment. Unions play a very good role when it comes to the elections, to training out the midterm elections as well as unemployment. You're talking about at least half, I understand at least half of the counties in Ohio have unemployment rates of more than 11 percent. That's much higher than the national average. So jobs is a very big deal in Ohio. And John and Kiran, that the bottom line here is that if you like the president's policies, you want to keep the House and the Senate in the Democratic hands. If you don't like the policies, you want to see that changed. But whether or not, whatever side you're on, this midterm election has been a huge difference in everybody's lives because you <COULD> see those policies actually repealed or reversed."

Most were directed at the sprawling Al Asad Air Base 140 miles west of Baghdad, home to hundreds of U.S. troops. Satellite images obtained by CNN show the before and after. Here, a number of buildings appear to have been destroyed or damaged next to a row of helicopters. Other buildings were also hit. Of 16 missiles launched, sources say that four appeared to have failed in flight. The president gave credit to an early warning system that the short-range missiles were incoming. U.S. intelligence satellites had picked up early signs that they'd been fueled up and then launched. Iran had also warned the Iraqi government, likely knowing that it would be passed on to the Americans, which gave U.S. troops a chance to take cover. Some Trump administration officials now telling CNN that they see Iran's strike as intentionally missing areas where Americans were housed, so that they weren't killed, but a clear message was sent.",

Blecher said he is not denying a new report that the Clippers owner is suing the NBA for damages in excess of $1 billion. His office tells us they <MAY> have something posted on their website shortly. Now, does all of this mean he's contesting the sale of the Clippers? <MAYBE>. Maybe not. Earlier today Maxwell Blecher had told us Sterling would look at the sale of the Clippers to Steve Ballmer and decide where to go from there, saying, quote, \"He doesn't want to fight with Shelly. That's the bottom line.\" That's a quote from Max Blecher to me on the phone earlier today. I don't <KNOW> what the lawsuit means versus what he said to me about contesting the sale, Wolf. Another key piece of news we have today. Sources telling us the doctors have determined Donald Sterling to be mentally incapacitated. This was a finding by two independent doctors, neurologists, presumably, we <BELIEVE>, earlier this month in two different examinations. And we have learned from one source that there is a clause in the trust between Donald and Shelly Sterling that says if one of them were to become mentally unfit, then the other would be the sole trustee. And that presumably opened the door for her to negotiate that sale with Steve Ballmer. Again, I tried to get reaction. I did get reaction from Maxwell Blecher to that finding. He said that's a vast overstatement of mental incapacitation. That this was a diagnosis really of, quote, \"modest mental impairment.\" And that maybe something akin to just slowing down mentally. And he is basically saying that mental incapacitation is not the case. At least not that degree of it."

In Afghanistan, U.S. Army special forces attacked two Taliban compounds today, killing about 12 fighters and taking 27 prisoners. The Pentagon says an American soldier was wounded, but his injury is not life-threatening. The fighting happened some 35 miles north of Kandahar. And here in Washington, supporters of campaign finance reform say they have collected 218 signatures, enough to force a vote on the issue on the House floor. No date has been set for debate and vote on the bill, which would virtually ban what's called soft money. Those are the unlimited sums that go to politicians. Campaign finance reform passed the Senate last year, but stalled in the House of Representatives. Widespread campaign donations by Enron helped fuel the move toward finance campaign reform in the House. And today, Capitol Hill began focusing on Enron's dramatic collapse. How did it happen and who knew what and when? Today, both the House and Senate opened hearings into the matter.

        "previous_statement": "Good evening. I`m Nancy Grace. I want to thank you for being with us. Live, Tampa. Police race to a million-dollar mansion to find a little girl at her bedroom computer doing homework, dead, her little brother still buckled in the minivan, dead. Then they find Mommy out lounging by the luxury pool in the back yard, who calmly explains she guns down her two children, shooting them in the mouth, because they talked back. In the last hours, we hear from Mommy herself, Mommy`s journal, in which she details her innermost thoughts and feelings about how she`s going to shoot her children dead. Let`s take a look at what Mommy said in her own writing. This is what I observed in court. Mommy now has her hair pulled back, mousey brown, in a bun. She won`t look at any of the witnesses. She won`t turn around and look at her husband, Colonel Parker Schenecker. She sits there acting like she`s taking notes, as if nothing`s going on around her. But let`s take a look into Mommy`s life. Let`s see the screens, Liz - - what we learned that Mommy writes in her journal. I did all my duties. Then I went to buy a gun. I was planning a Saturday massacre, but had to wait for a background investigation for three days. Let`s keep it going. Calyx called me pathetic. On Saturday, she called me an evil soul. The evil starts Thursday. Calyx, you know what? She gets it first. Don`t know whether I`ll turn on the light (to blind) or just react to have me in her bedroom. I`m nervous. Next -- I offed Beau on the way to practice. I offed Beau on the way to practice. He saw the gun and told me to put it back in the purse. He had a healthy fight, then when we got home, a shot to his mouth (because) he became so mouthy, just like Calyx. Calyx drove me to drink. He (Beau) was yelling at me. The first shot hit the windshield. Second shot was the side of his head. Next shot to the mouth, his mouthy mouth. Came home. Calyx is on the upstairs computer. Asked, What are you doing? Just (seeing) what you are doing, walked up without her reacting and shot her in the right temple. Then shot her in the mouth (her sassy little mouth). Really tore my soul to the core. Shot the two mouthy mouths in the mouth after shooting them in the head. I`m just losing my mind. I`d like to die by Beau in our bed. That would be nice. Beau and I are going to heaven. Wish heaven for Calyx, too. \"Wish.\" Whoa! Lucky you weren`t there -- talking to her husband. Probably would have offed you, too. Would have been a crying shame. I sensed divorce was inevitable, but I can`t live alone.\" All right, straight out to Roger Schulman, Tampa radio reporter in court today, Roger with me in the courtroom all day yesterday. Roger, as I watched Colonel Parker Schenecker in the courtroom, I could tell he was about to burst into tears. Today, he was on the stand. What did you observe?",

You have to go through a lot of check points. A lot of people are blaming security more than ISIS of what happened. The blame really here is at these explosive detectors that the Iraqis had been using for years now. Basically, is what is known as The One (ph). When you go through a check point, security forces and military would use explosive detector to check if cars carrying explosives and what would happen is this detector would point to a possibility of explosives in the car or the car would be sent for additional screening. The problem here is that this explosive detector years ago was found to be fake. The manufacture was sentenced to 10 years in prison in the United Kingdom for fraud. He sold this detector to several countries <AROUND> the world. This is been pulled off the market. And British police at that time described is a fancy golf ball detector that's still being used in Baghdad, and up until that attack happened. A lot of questions about why it was still being used even though authorities knew it was fake and it had failed to pick up explosives. We heard the Iraqis prime minister coming out with a late statement last night where he's ordering detectors to pull off check point and he's re-launching an investigation into how these approaches of these detectors were made and how they ended up on Iraq's streets. Right now, at this point, Rosemary, a lot of anger and frustration and they have endured so much and really they're getting to a point where they cannot take this anymore.

Multiple House Democrat witnesses, including those from the Department of State, the National Security Council and others, unanimously testified there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest. These were their witnesses. How much money did Hunter Biden get for being on the board? Well, if you start looking at these bank records, according to reports, between April 2014 and October 2015, Burisma paid more than $3.1 million to Devon Archer and Hunter Biden. That's over the course of a year and a half. How do we <KNOW> this? Some of Devon Archer's bank records were disclosed during an unrelated federal criminal case having nothing to do with Hunter Biden. These bank records show 17 months that Burisma wired two payments of $83,333 not just for one month, for two months, for three months, but for 17 months. According to Reuters, sources report that of the two payments of $83,333 each, one was for Hunter Biden and one, Devon Archer. Now, Hunter Biden was paid significantly more than board members from major U.S. Fortune 100 companies such as Goldman Sachs, Comcast, Citigroup. A typical board member of these Fortune 100 companies -- we know they're titans of their industry, they're highly qualified and as such, they're well compensated -- even so, Hunter Biden was paid significantly more. This is how well he was compensated. So Hunter Biden is paid over $83,000 a month, while the average American family of four, during that time, each year, made less than $54,000. And that's according to the U.S. Census Bureau during that time. And this is what's been reported about his work on the board. The Washington Post said, quote, \"What specific duties Hunter Biden carried out for Burisma are not fully known,\" end quote. The New Yorker reported, quote, \"Once or twice a year, he attended Burisma board meetings and energy forums that took place in Europe,\" end quote. When speaking with ABC News about his qualifications to be on Burisma's board, Hunter Biden didn't point to any of the usual qualifications of a board member. Hunter Biden had no experience in natural gas, no experience in the energy sector, no experience with Ukrainian regulatory affairs. As far as we know, he doesn't speak Ukrainian. So naturally, the media has asked questions about his board membership. Why was Hunter Biden on this board?"

This has life and death consequences and so when the President wings it, when he acts on instinct and impulse, when he acts on something he saw on the internet or something somebody told him, and then Tony Fauci or somebody else has to go up and say, well, that's aspirational or the President's trying to give you <HOPE>, but please do not do this at home. Remember from the early days of the administration, his own aides telling us why are you reading the President's tweets, listen to what we say not what he tweets. Well, that's not the way it works. He's the President of the United States. There are people listening to him. One other quick point I want to get in, though, because it is important what the President says. It's important when he says things that are reckless and wrong that his own people have to correct him. But today, he also did something else very important, he acknowledged there will be a phase four. He signed that stimulus bill today. He acknowledged there will be a phase four. Many House conservatives are nervous in an election year. They're not in a hurry to spend more money. The President said, <GUESS> what, we're going to spend more money and it's going to have to include aid to the states. A lot of those Democratic governors who have been critical of the President are going to write that down and try to hold him to it."

Troops get frank talk from General Stanley McChrystal. From the start of symptoms to seriously sick to super quick, there can be a small window of opportunity with swine flu. We're going to tell you when to take your kid to the M.D. and when to head straight to the E.R. And Congress isn't known for simplifying stuff, so we'll see what kind of clarity it can bring to the confusion over cancer screenings. We'll hit the hearing on Capitol Hill. Really quickly right now, we're waiting on the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, to come out for a briefing. The first time the White House will take questions since the president's speech last night. And, of course, we're expecting a lot of questions about the Afghan war strategy. We'll hit that as soon as it starts. And now for something completely extraordinary: General Stanley McChrystal, in Kandahar, addressing U.S. troops and Afghan leaders, talking about the new plan and how he plans to push it forward. CNN got access, exclusive access, that you just don't see that often: the top commander talking about the road ahead. He wrapped up just about an hour ago. Here you go.",

I believe that by this time next year we'll see a level of progress that will convince us that we can <CLEARLY> articulate the progress and predict the effect -- the effectiveness of our operations. And I believe that by the summer of 2011, that will be obvious to all the players involved: to the Taliban, to the insurgents, I <THINK> it will be obvious to the Afghan national security forces. It will be obvious to us, and it will be obvious to the Afghan people in all of those areas. And that's the critical point. So that we can offer them the confidence that we're going to be able to provide that security. Counterinsurgency starts, as you <KNOW>, with protecting the people, because at the end of the day, the people are what we are here for. We're here to respect the Afghan people. We're here to protect the Afghan people. We're here to enable the Afghan people, to build their country. We're not going to nation-build. What we are going to do is allow a nation to nation-build. Now our mission is to prevent the insurgency from being an existential threat to the government of Afghanistan and prevent al Qaeda, or other international terrorists, from using Afghanistan as a safe haven. If you think about where we are now, even though it's eight years, this is not the end. This is not even the beginning of the end. I think it's the end of the beginning, and I think everything changes right now."

Also killed and mourned, 23-year-old Massad Abu-Asi (ph). He was shot dead by Israeli soldiers who said he ignored their warnings to stop at a crossing in Gaza. Also buried today, an Israeli man who was killed in an ambush as he drove his car in Hebron. There were other clashes around the occupied territories as well. In this incident, Israeli rubber bullets and tear gas injuring five Palestinians. An Israeli solder was also hurt.

I think the other question that Senator Warner left out is not only how high this goes, but how broadly, how wide this goes. Because, this, while coming clearly under the umbrella of a Russian effort to help the candidate, Trump, is around a fairly narrow set of questions. It does not, at least on the last information we have so far, which is probably not the last war we're going to have in this meeting. At least on the information we have so far does not yet implicate the question of either the hacking of the DNC and John Podesta's e-mail and or which I think is also an important area of investigation that the role of Russian agencies in spreading fake news and you know, misleading news stories targeted into key states in the U.S. election. And whether they had any help in deciding where from Moscow to target those efforts. I mean, those are, in many ways, the broader questions that most of the public is still focused on. This meeting at this point does not yet address that. But one thing I feel pretty confident about is that, as these stories have shifted, it's just under the glare of the news media.

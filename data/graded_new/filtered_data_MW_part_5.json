A majority, 61 percent, said they would want to know if they are predisposed to developing a genetic disease, 35 percent say they would not want to know. And on the question of how should -- who should have access to genetic information rather, 67 percent say it should be available to doctors and about one in five say insurance companies should have access to that information.

Earl Caldwell objected to that, so the exact person who will be chosen remains to be seen. The prosecution had also hoped in a separate motion to remove William Jordan, a private investigator who is assisting the defense team.

    "statement": "Hello, I'm Richard Quest. As we continue with QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment, Christine Lagarde tells me her biggest fear for the global economy is come complacency and slow growth. We'll talk about that in just a moment. Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook will hand over those notorious Russian ads to U.S. Congress. And as we continue, this is CNN and on this network the news always comes first. Mexico's navy now says all children have been accounted for in an elementary school that has been the subject of search and rescue efforts. More than 48 hours after a devastating earthquake hit. Rescuers are now <HOPING> to reach at least one person who <MAY> <POSSIBLY> still be alive. The quake has killed at least 250 people across central Mexico. Officials say the island of Dominica has gone into survival mode after being hit by hurricane Maria. People are in desperate need of food, water and medical supplies. Even the Prime Minister's homeless. At least 15 people on the island are known to have died in the storm. President Trump has announced new sanctions against North Korea targeting firms and individuals who trade with the country. He also says China has ordered to stop its banks doing business with Pyongyang. No official response from China's central bank. The Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, took a dig at the United States during the United Nations on Thursday. Saying there is no country on the planet that can walkway from the challenge and reality of climate change. Remember, President Trump announced in July he's pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Kenya says it's moving the new presidential election to October the 26th. The country's Supreme Court annulled last month's election. President Uhuru Kenyatta says that amounted to a coup. His opponent, Raila Odinga called it fraudulent. Wall Street's winning streak has come to an end. The Dow briefly had an intraday high and then it fell back -- very briefly. Look at it. Right at the beginning of the day. A smidgeon of green on the top left of your screen. Things turned thereafter. It was off 53 points, ending nine straight days of gains and seven days of record closures. The S&P and Nasdaq both closed slightly lower, as well. Let's put this into context. The Dow is still up 30 percent for the year and is closed at a record of 42 times since the beginning of the year. The IMF's managing director says she's worried about complacency as markets hit record after record and economies enjoy steady growth. Christine Lagarde is warning there's a whole generation that is yet to experience a serious market correction. Speaking to me, she urged governments to make structural changes now and ensure a rising economic tide lifts all countries."

This is something that we can build on. This is a point for unification not just in Chicago, but throughout the country. There needs to be better training, better community engagement. And we have to insure that our officers are standing up if are the policies and procedures for which they were trained because that's the only way to bring some healing and some unity around these issues."

I think the other is that Congressman Adam Schiff said today that they were going to call him to their committee and to be able to be in front of that committee and testify. Mueller is looking at him because he believes he has something and some information that is necessary. And for him to think that Sam, that he can sit there and say, I'm not going to go, is as -- ludicrous, as -- look at the justice system and giving it the finger.

        "statement": "Breaking news out of Japan. Late word tonight that Japan's Nuclear Safety Agency has found even higher radiation spikes in seawater near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Now, radioactive iodine levels, more than 4,000 times the regulatory limit in the sea near the plant. Last night, you may remember, those levels were more than 3,000 times the regulatory level. This followed some troubling news from the International Automatic Energy Agency that today, it found elevated radiation levels in a town 25 miles from the plant, which is <WELL> outside the current evacuation zone. So today, TEPCO's chairman said the company has no choice but to decommission four of the crippled plant's six reactors. He's taken over the fight to bring the crisis under control, because TEPCO's president is back in the hospital once again, said to be battling from, quote, \"stress and fatigue\". Also feeling stress and fatigue, no doubt -- probably a lot more -- the workers struggling to bring those reactors under control on little sleep and just two meals a day. We have new details tonight on just why it is that workers are having such a hard time eating. The problem isn't just finding uncontaminated food, we're told. It's finding an uncontaminated space to eat it in. TEPCO says the workers will soon start getting three meals a day, possibly tomorrow. This, though, only after the information has been revealed that they weren't getting three meals a day. The company also says it's hoping to get workers staples like bread and soup very soon. That's right. They haven't had bread or soup. They've had a lot of crackers. For now, they're powering through on meals nothing more than rice and a special protein mix, occasionally crackers, because they come in sealed packages. As for a reported shortage of protective gear, TEPCO admits supplies may be running short, but they claim there is still enough protective clothing for everyone who's working at the site, and they're buying more as they need it. Joining us now with the latest in the battle to bring the Fukushima Daiichi plant under control: from Hong Kong, former senior nuclear power plant operator Michael Friedlander; and in L.A., our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Michael, do you believe this company, TEPCO, now? I mean, I've got to say, given the lack of information, the lack of flow of information that we've had, really, since day one in this thing, the misinformation that we've been given, and we've seen workers getting doused with radioactive water, do you believe that they have the right protective gear?"

And I ran away from home when I was 17. And having finished high school, and this was part, sort of youthful rebellion, part rejecting my mother's worrying -- what I considered my mother's very boring life. And ended on a Kibbutz in the northern part of Israel just in time for the 1973 Yom Kippur war. But instead of scaring me, it just enchanted me. I was acutely aware of, first of all, being a very green reporter because I got very lucky, I was hired right out of school by the \"Wall Street Journal,\" and was within a year covering Central America. I was acutely aware <ACTUALLY> of being a woman and travelling in these places. And this was at a time when there weren't a lot of women, foreign correspondents. I could often get a foot in the door. I could get interviews that my male counterparts couldn't. Once I got the interview, however, it was sometimes a struggle, a challenge to get them to take me seriously. But so that was the challenge. It was to -- I was there to make it work. So, yes, <I THINK> we have come a long way. But <I THINK> as with most professions, there is still a lot more that can be done."

Now, one would think that, more than eight years after 9/11, that's already happening. It's a massive job, considering how much information the intelligence community gets. Mr. Obama also ordered beefed up analysis of all the reams of information that come in, which you would have to have in order to determine which threats are high-priority and which are not. And the president also ordered faster and wider dissemination of intelligence reports involving potential threats to the U.S. -- pretty simple stuff.

Going back to SARS and comparing to now, the reason we talk about SARS so much, by the way, is that it's the same family of virus. SARS was also a coronavirus. But <LOOK> back. At the end -- sort of end of the outbreak in 2003, there were about 5,300 cases of SARS in China. There's already, as you mentioned, over 6,000 cases but there are fewer deaths. So the -- what we call the fatality or mortality ratio is lower now, as compared to SARS. These numbers are early, the numbers will certainly change a lot. But when you hear about significant spread, Hala, you see a lot more people who contract the virus. If the number of people who have died does not go up sort of in an equivalent ratio, what that might mean is that there's a lot of people out there who are getting this infection, but either have no symptoms or very minimal symptoms. So it's a good news-bad news situation. You don't want this to spread, <OBVIOUSLY>, but if it's in tens of thousands of people and not that many people have died from that, the fatality ratio will come down dramatically. I always mention -- and <I THINK> you and I have talked about this in the past, but -- the flu in the United States for example, flu has killed over 8,000 people, 8,000 people have died of flu, <OBVIOUSLY> a much bigger number but it's something that we're more familiar with and have recognized for a long time, <OBVIOUSLY>."

        "statement": "<WELL>, <YOU KNOW>, I was in Munich at the National Security Conference and talking with leaders from other parts of the world, the president of Afghanistan, the president of Iraq. And clearly this has been kind of a body blow to our cooperation. They're still working with us. But it just got a lot more difficult. And you can imagine, if we're trying to recruit sources, we're trying to gather intelligence, and people that we're working with or hope to work with, their last, <YOU KNOW>, chance if they are discovered is the hope that they can emigrate, that they can find protection in the United States. If we can't offer that anymore, if that's suddenly in question, or more broadly, people don't want to work with us because they think our country is hostile to Islam or hostile to people from their country, it just makes the job that much more difficult."

Now let's delve deeper between the alleged connection with the U.K. car bombs and al Qaeda in Iraq. I spoke earlier with our man in Baghdad, Michael Ware. Michael, thanks so much for joining us here in THE SITUATION ROOM. I want to start off by talking about the London terror plot. There are now reports that one of the perpetrators, one of those doctors involved in the plot received training from al Qaeda, possibly in Iraq. From your reporting, are you seeing evidence that al Qaeda is training potential would-be terrorists, exporting those folks to places in Europe and overseas?",
        "statement": "<WELL>, Suzanne, the short answer is yes. I mean, that's been part of al Qaeda and Iraq's grand design, that ultimately they would be exporting terror. And <OF COURSE>, you will recall that we saw the hotel bombings in neighboring Jordan in the capital Amman. That was carried out by al Qaeda in Iraq. We also have Intel reports from Kuwaiti officials, Lebanese officials, Syrian officials, others in the region saying that they are picking up al Qaeda veterans from Iraq or al Qaeda in Iraq, veterans, the graduating class coming back, recruiting, training, forming cells. I mean this is precisely what happened in the 1980s after Afghanistan. It's the same thing. When the Russians were defeated by Afghan fighters and by the Arabs who went to fight against them in the name of jihad, these Arabs went home and they became the heroes and around them formed groups and cells. And, eventually, we saw the emergence of al Qaeda itself, so this is going to be -- and we've said this for a long time -- one of the true great legacies of the war in Iraq. And that is going to be the ferment of a whole new era of al Qaeda jihadists that will come out of this place."

The famed illusionist David Copperfield is the focus of a sexual assault investigation.

He had Hope Hicks, Donald Trump Jr., and a lawyer with the Trump organization involved in the writing of this statement, and it was in response to a \"Times\" story that was coming about Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer during the campaign in the summer of 2016. Specifically we've learned a couple of things. One is who was involved in the drafting, how it came about. We get into, you know, how it sparked an enormous amount of infighting. A significant piece in our story is Mark Corallo who is a spokesperson for the president's legal team for a time is anticipated to tell Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigators who want to speak with him and that is in previously reported, but about a conference call that he was on with Hope Hicks and the president the day after \"The New York Times\" story ran. It was a weekend, so this would have been a Sunday, where they were discussing e-mails involving a discussion between Donald Trump Jr. and people setting up the meeting that described its intent as about offering up dirt on Hillary Clinton. Hope Hicks allegedly said that those e-mails would, \"never get out.\" Her lawyer denies that was said. Corallo is expected to tell investigators that he wondered whether that meant she was looking to obstruct justice. Again, I want to make clear that her lawyer has insisted she was never discussing anything about destroying documents. But it is another turn of the screw in how they handled what was one of the deepest crises of last year.",

        "previous_statement": "Well, look, I think this is a great question, Ali (ph). And so let me -- let me try to be as specific as I can about the costs of doing nothing. I've already mentioned that health care costs are going up much faster than inflation, all right, so your wages, your income, if you're lucky, right now, maybe they're going up 2 percent a year, maybe 3 percent a year. For a lot of people, they're not going up at all, because the economy is in tough shape.",
        "statement": "But your health care costs are going up 6 percent, 7 percent a year. Some people are getting notices in their mail their premium just went up 20 percent. On that trajectory, health care costs will probably double again -- your premiums will probably double again over the next 10 years. They may even go up faster than that. The costs of Medicare are going to keep on rising a lot faster than tax revenues coming in, which means that the trust fund, you've got more money going out than is coming in, which makes that more unstable. And we know that, if we do nothing, we will probably end up seeing more people uninsured. We're already seeing 14,000 people lose their health insurance every day, 14,000 people. So the costs of doing nothing are trillions of dollars in costs over the next couple of decades, trillions, not billions, but trillions of dollars in costs without anybody getting any better care. So what we've said is, if we can control health care inflation -- how fast costs are going up -- then not only can we stabilize the Medicare trust fund, not only can we help save families money on their premiums, but we can <ACTUALLY> afford to provide coverage to the people who currently don't have health care. Now, here's the problem, that in order for us to save money, in some cases, we've got to spend some money up front. Let me give you some very specific examples. Health care I.T. -- health care is the only area where you still have to fill out five different forms. When you go into a bank, you don't have to do that. You've got an ATM. If you use your credit card, they'll find you real quick and the billing is real easy, right? But for some reason, when you go into health care, you fill out pencil and paper. I guess they Xerox it. They give it to somebody else. Sometimes you see their files, and it's all stuffed with papers, and nurses can't read the doctor's handwriting. So for us to set up a system like they have at the Cleveland Clinic that I just visited in Ohio, where every medical record -- your privacy is protected -- but everything is digitalized, everything -- the minute you take a test, it goes to all the doctors and all the specialists that you might end up dealing with. So you end up just having that one test instead of having to then go back to the doctor again and again and again and have a bunch of different tests. <WELL>, that saves money, but you've got to get the computer equipment in the first place to do it. So, in some cases, we've got to spend some money on the front end. I also think that, if we provide coverage for people who don't have health insurance right now, then they are going to be getting preventive care, they're going to be getting screenings, and so they don't end up in the emergency room with really expensive care that all of us are paying for, even though we don't know it. The average family is spending about $900 a year in higher health care premiums because they are paying indirectly for uncompensated health care. Essentially, the insurance companies charge you a little more and hospitals and doctors, they're all charging you a little bit more because they're not getting reimbursed for people who don't have any care whatsoever. So what we've done is we've said, <LOOK>, over 10 years, the health care reform proposals to cover everybody would cost about a trillion dollars over 10 years, so that's about $100 billion a year. Keep in mind we spend $2 trillion every year on health care, so this is just a fraction of what we spend. But we're talking about a trillion dollars over 10 years. That's $100 billion a year. About 60 percent of that can be paid for by taking money that's already in the system but isn't working to make you healthier. That can pay for about 60 percent of it. So, really, what we're talking about is another $30 billion to $40 billion every year to cover everybody, and we're going to get most of that money back if we're providing more prevention, more wellness, doctors and hospitals are being reimbursed more intelligently. Over time, that money -- that investment will more than pay for itself. But Ali (ph) is exactly right. <YOU KNOW>, you get these stories where, oh, there's a trillion dollars here, a trillion dollars there, after a while, it starts being real money, even here in Washington. And so I understand people being scared that this is going to be way too costly. It's not that costly if we start making changes right now."

In other words, usually, it's an organized crime figure illegally gets money or a drug dealer illegally gets money and he's got to wash the money so he could re-spend it on something else. This is different money laundering though because this is presumably legitimately obtained money. They didn't get their money from drug dealing. But they want to disguise the use of the money. They're pretending it's being used legitimately as a charitable contribution. In fact, it's being used to bribe their way or drive their child's way into college.

Lots of signs down, some shingles down from the homes, some trees, some limbs down, very little other damage. And what the people here have learned is, they can tolerate a Category 2 hurricane very well. Of course, this is the southern edge of the hurricane warning zone. But they have had huge problems here in the past with smaller storms with floods. But what's happened in this storm is, the winds have blown from my left. And over to my left is the Intracoastal Waterway, which separates this island from the North Carolina mainland. By the way, we're near Camp Lejeune, where we spent a lot of time before, during and after the war. Three blocks wide, this island. The other side of me is where the Atlantic Ocean is. And because this is such a narrow sliver of land, 26 miles long, but only three blocks wide, they've had a lot of problems with flooding. But the winds have blown towards the ocean and they've had almost no flooding whatsoever. We've driven up and down this island, and then to the north, towards Morehead City. And we can tell you, while there is some damage, so far, we haven't seen any major damage of any kind here or north of here, closer to where the eye was. And that's the good news. Behind me, there is a bridge. That is the major bridge. It takes people off Topsail Island to the mainland. That bridge will be shut down until 9:00 tomorrow morning. Officials say it's only for emergency vehicles. So anyone on this island who decided to stay who wants to get off it will have to wait until at least tomorrow morning. The winds are still strong.

Basically, what it's going to tell you is that -- from what I heard from a source, is that the majority of the service members who responded to this study don't have a problem with repealing \"don't ask, don't tell.\" That the majority think it's either going to have a positive impact. Somewhat mixed results are really no effect at all. That the number who think it's going to have a negative effect is fairly small. And really, that's sort of mirrors the population at large here in America. I mean, if you <LOOK> at a new Pew Research Center poll, it's going to show that about 58 percent of Americans think it's OK for gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military. Only 27 percent opposed that. That's a 31-point gap. And just to sort of put that in perspective and show you how attitudes have changed and shifted over the years, back in 1994 when \"don't ask, don't tell\" was put in place, that gap was only seven points -- John."

        "statement": "This is one that will probably be in the history books long after you and I are no longer in THE SITUATION ROOM. It was momentous. In the process of reaching out to the world's 1.5 billion Muslims with today's speech, it's unclear if President Obama, in the process, was also pushing away America's longtime ally, Israel. Speaking in Cairo, the president recognized the U.S.' \"unbreakable bond\" with the Jewish state and the horror of the Holocaust, but he also talked about the suffering of the Palestinian people. He described their situation as intolerable, and he stressed the need for a two-state solution. President Obama called on Palestinians to abandon violence, pointing to America's own civil rights history and saying that it was a peaceful and determined insistence that brought about equal rights for African-Americans. And he once again called upon Israel to stop building the settlements and to allow Palestinians to live and work and develop their own society. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already rejected President Obama's call for a freeze on those settlements, but experts suggest that this demand from Mr. Obama will make the Arab world <LISTEN>. They say although the U.S. has been opposed to Israeli settlements for decades, past American presidents have looked the other way and allowed Israel to just keep building them. And some believe that if \"no\" really means \"no\" this time around, <WELL>, it may be easier to form a regional coalition against Iran. And speaking of Iran, Mr. Obama repeated his belief today the Islamic republic has the right to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes. That's another statement that's probably not going to sit real <WELL> with the Israelis. And finally, for the first time in a long time, a visit to the Middle East by a sitting U.S. president did not include a stop in Israel. So here's the question: Is President Obama reaching out to Muslims at the expense of America's relationship with Israel? Go to cnn.com/caffertyfile and post a comment on my blog. Pretty big stuff."

You have industries affiliates (ph) stakes here that's why it's been so difficult. But the difference between health care and tax reform is ideological alignment. When it came to health care, if you took Ted Cruz and Susan Collins, there was never a way that you were going to bridge the gap on how they viewed the health care industry or the health care marketplace should exist. That is not the case on taxes. Ted Cruz and Susan Collins both believe in tax cuts, have both run campaigns on tax cuts. So, you take that and then you take the stinging defeat of health care. One of the interesting elements, I'd just speaking to one lobbyist last night just kind of recounting how all this happened. He talked about going to fund-raisers for members after the August recess and he asked each one of them, who is getting the blame for the health care failure back in your district? Everybody is talking about President Trump, how he's not doing this <WELL>. And to a person, he told me, every single member told him no one says President Trump is bad at his job. Everybody says we are bad at this job.

And two other women who as this train was moving were able to jump out of the train car just before the blast went off. Now Russian officials say they had help from outside. They say that there was a car parked next to the train tracks that some of the eyewitnesses reported seeing that appeared to be observing or coordinating this attack. Also the head of the Russian federal security service very interestingly said they retained two women in the neighboring republic of Ingushetia -- that's also right next to Chechnya -- that were preparing suicide bombing attacks, but he didn't explain whether they had any connection with this one today -- Miles."

And I believe the West and the international community should intervene to put an end to these atrocities in order to regain their credibility, exactly the way they did when they intervened in Kosovo, when they intervened in East Timor.

We certainly hope so because <YOU KNOW> Americans all over <YOU KNOW> since March have been changing their ways, their way of life in terms of mask, I've got a mask right here and when I go on to the hallway in CNN, I'm getting my temperature checked and the idea that this White House was so <WELL> sort of lackadaisical in their approach to folks who were coming to work every day.

        "previous_statement": "Straight to the president of the United States with developments in the Middle East and overall war on terror.",
        "statement": "Today I met with members of my national security team, both here at the State Department and at the Pentagon. I want to, first of all, thank the leadership of Secretary Condi Rice and Secretary Don Rumsfeld. During those discussions, we talked about the need to transform our military to meet the threats of the 21st century. We discussed the global war on terror. We discussed the situation on the ground in three fronts of the global war on terror: in Lebanon and Iraq and Afghanistan. Friday's U.N. Security Council resolution on Lebanon is an important step forward that will help bring an end to the violence. The resolution calls for a robust international force to deploy to the southern part of the country to help Lebanon's legitimate armed forces restore the sovereignty of its democratic government all Lebanese territory. As <WELL>, the resolution is intended to stop Hezbollah from acting as a state within the state. We're now working with our international partners to turn the words of this resolution into action. We must help people in both Lebanon and Israel return to their homes and begin rebuilding their lives without fear of renewed violence and terror. America recognizes that civilians in Lebanon and Israel have suffered from the current violence. And we recognize that responsibility for this suffering lies with Hezbollah. It was an unprovoked attack by Hezbollah on Israel that started this conflict. Hezbollah terrorists targeted Israeli civilians with daily rocket attacks. Hezbollah terrorists used Lebanese civilians as human shields, sacrificing the innocent in an effort to protect themselves from Israeli response. Responsibility for the suffering of the Lebanese people also lies with Hezbollah's state sponsors, Iran and Syria. The regime in Iran provides Hezbollah with financial support, weapons and training. Iran has made clear that it seeks the destruction of Israel. We can only imagine how much more dangerous this conflict would be if Iran had the nuclear weapon it seeks. Syria's another state sponsor of Hezbollah. Syria allows Iranian weapons to pass through its territory into Lebanon. Syria permits Hezbollah's leaders to operate out of Damascus and gives political support to Hezbollah's cause. Syria supports Hezbollah because it wants to undermine Lebanon's democratic government and regain its position of dominance in the country. That would be a great tragedy for the Lebanese people and for the cause of peace in the Middle East. Hezbollah and its foreign sponsors also seek to undermine the prospects for peace in the Middle East. Hezbollah terrorists kidnapped two Israeli soldiers. Hamas kidnapped another Israeli soldier for a reason: Hezbollah and Hamas reject a vision of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. Both groups want to disrupt the progress being made toward that vision by Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas and others in the region. We must not allow terrorists to prevent elected leaders from working together toward a comprehensive peace agreement in the Middle East. The conflict in Lebanon is part of a broader struggle between freedom and terror that is unfolding across the region. For decades, American policy sought to achieve peace in the Middle East by promoting stability in the Middle East. Yet, the lack of freedom in the region meant anger and resentment grew, radicalism thrived, and terrorists found willing recruits. We saw the consequences on September 11, 2001, when terrorists brought death and destruction to our country, killing nearly 3,000 of our citizens. So we launched a forward strategy of freedom in the broader Middle East. And that strategy has helped bring hope to millions and fostered the birth of young democracies from Baghdad to Beirut. Forces of terror see the changes that are taking place in their midst. They understand that the advance of liberty, the freedom to worship, the freedom to dissent, the protection of human rights would be a defeat for their hateful ideology. But they also know that young democracies are fragile and that this may be their last and best opportunity to stop freedom's advance and steer newly free nations to the path of radical extremism. So the terrorists are striking back with all the destructive power that they can muster. It's no coincidence that two nations that are building free societies in the heart of the Middle East -- Lebanon and Iraq -- are also the scenes of the most violent terrorist activity. Some say that America caused the current instability in the Middle East by pursuing a forward strategy of freedom, yet history shows otherwise. We didn't talk much about freedom or the freedom agenda in the Middle East before September 11th, 2001; or before Al Qaeda first attacked the World Trade Center and blew up our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in the 1990s; or before Hezbollah killed hundreds of Americans in Beirut and Islamic radicals held American hostages in Iran in the 1980s. History's clear: The freedom agenda did not create the terrorists or their ideology, but the freedom agenda will help defeat them both. Some say that the violence and instability we see today means that the people of this troubled region are not ready for democracy. I disagree. Over the past five years people across the Middle East have bravely defied the car bombers and assassins to show the world that they want to live in liberty. We see the universal desire for liberty in the 12 million Iraqis who faced down the terrorists to cast their ballots and elected a free government under a democratic constitution. We see the universal desire for liberty in 8 million Afghans who lined up to vote for the first democratic government in the long history of their country. We see the universal desire for liberty in the Lebanese people, who took to the streets to demand their freedom and help drive Syrian forces out of their country. The problem in the Middle East today is not that people lack the desire for freedom. The problem is that young democracies that they have established are still vulnerable to terrorists and their sponsors. One vulnerability is that many of the new democratic governments in the region have not yet established effective control over all their territory. In both Lebanon and Iraq, elected governments are contending with rogue armed groups that are seeking to undermine and destabilize them. In Lebanon, Hezbollah declared war on Lebanon's neighbor Israel without the knowledge of the elected government in Beirut. In Iraq, Al Qaeda and death squads engage in brutal violence to undermine the unity government. And in both these countries, Iran is backing armed groups in the hope of stopping democracy from taking hold. The message of this administration is clear: America will stay on the offense against Al Qaeda. Iran must stop its support for terror. And the leaders of these armed groups must make a choice: If they want to participate in the political life of their countries, they must disarm. Elected leaders cannot have one foot in the camp of democracy and one foot in the camp of terror. The Middle East is at a pivotal moment in its history. The death and destruction we see shows how determined the extremists are to stop just and modern societies from emerging in the region. Yet millions of people in Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere are equally determined to live in peace and freedom. They have tired of the false promises and grand illusions of radical extremists. They reject the hateful vision of the terrorists, and they dream of a better future for their children and their grandchildren. We're determined to help them achieve that dream. America's actions have never been guided by territorial ambition. We seek to advance the cause of freedom in the Middle East because we know the security of the region and our own security depend on it. We know that free nations are America's best partners for peace and the only true anchors for stability. So we'll continue to support reformers inside and outside governments who are working to build the institutions of liberty. We'll continue to confront terrorist organizations and their sponsors who destroy innocent lives. We'll continue to work for the day when a democratic Israel and a democratic Palestine are neighbors in a peaceful and secure Middle East. The way forward's going to be difficult. It will require more sacrifice. But we can be confident of the outcome because we know and understand the unstoppable power of freedom. In a Middle East that grows in freedom and democracy, people will have a chance to raise their families and live in peace and build a better future. In a Middle East that grows in freedom and democracy, the terrorists will lose their recruits and lose their sponsors and lose safe havens from which to launch new attacks. In a Middle East that grows in freedom and democracy there will be no room for tyranny and terror, and that will make America and other free nations more secure. Now I'll be glad to answer a couple of questions."

October 1973, President Nixon fires Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox in the midst of his investigation into Watergate. The attorney general and his top deputy leave rather than fire Cox. Federal agents seal off the special prosecutor's office. Could a president shut off an inquiry into his own behavior? It didn't happen. A firestorm of public pressure forced Nixon to name a successor, Leon Jaworski, who demanded of Nixon those famous secret tape recordings. And that could have triggered a real constitutional crisis when a unanimous Supreme Court ordered Nixon to turn over the tapes. Suppose he had refused, one branch of government defying the order of another. But it didn't happen. Nixon turned the tapes over, the smoking gun of a cover-up was disclosed and the president resigned. But this? Not even close, yet. What you have so far is the messy, inefficient business of vote counts. Instead of troops in the Capitol, you've got lawyers in the courts. Instead of mobs in the street, street theater, folks with a little too much time on their hands. (on camera): So, could this turn into a crisis? <OF COURSE> we're not talking about anyone seizing political power or some adversary from abroad sailing up the Potomac, but we could be talking about a transfer of power tainted by charges of foul play; an angry challenge to the electoral vote when the new Congress convenes in January; a bitter refusal of the losing side to acknowledge the victor's right to govern; a new Congress that, for all the talk of cooperation, is frozen into inaction by a sense of icy bitterness that's grown over the last 20 years. A crisis? Maybe not. But as an unhappy ending to all this, that would do."

And also <I THINK> finally, it's going to be a big leap for this country to have an African-American presidential nominee and <I THINK> for some voters who might be a little nervous about that, they would be looking for a reassuring pick.

Saddam Hussein was a threat, yes, because he was trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction. And, yes, we thought that he was -- that he had stockpiles, which he did not have. We had problems with the intelligence. We are all, as a collective polity of the United States, trying to deal with ways to get better intelligence. But it wasn't just weapons of mass destruction. He was also a place -- his territory was a place where terrorists were welcomed, where he paid suicide bombers to bomb Israel, where he had used Scuds against Israel in the past, and so we knew what his intentions were in the region, where he had attacked his neighbors before and, in fact, tried to annex Kuwait, where we'd gone to war against him twice in the past. It was the total picture, Senator, not just weapons of mass destruction, that caused us to decide that post-September 11th, it was finally time to deal with Saddam Hussein.",

They're going to focus on two issues, specifically they said E-verify and agriculture farming visas. Those are the ones they're going to try and work out over the course of the next couple of days. The goal being that if you solve those two issues, perhaps you can get the votes needed to <ACTUALLY> pass a broad overhaul. Now a couple of points here that are important to remember. Whatever the House Republicans do, even if they do get the votes to pass, doesn't technically have a future. And Senate Democrats have made clear they won't support anything the House is working on. That said, Republicans are willing to keep giving this a shot, trying to get past where they currently are which is nothing. Will they <ACTUALLY> get there? <LOOK>, I've been talking to aides since this announcement was <ACTUALLY> made and the reality is nobody is sure and they understand it's a long path. That said, leaders have decided to give their members a few more days to try and figure something out, a few more days to get a broad immigration overhaul one supported by the president across the finish line -- guys."

So the resources were readily available to the president. Obviously, the -- tensions have been ramping up with Iran for quite some time, so no question in my mind that they were ready to go. Obviously there's existing plans that they probably dusted off and modified for the circumstances for last night. So getting those aircraft in the air, getting those ships armed and ready, not a huge deal. It's really just a matter of targeting and laying those targets into the systems and the sensors. It's likewise pretty quickly to turn something like that off because the military has such robust communications capability. I'm not surprised that they were able to react as quickly as they did to the president's order. So the message on Iran, I found Joe Johns' reporting earlier in the hour very interesting about how the White House didn't push back on \"The New York Times\" story that the president had made this decision sort of late in the game and that they were OK having that out there. So clearly whatever drove the president to make this decision, and the general kind of outlaid some ideas there, it did have a strategic communications benefit to him, for the president, to have it out there that he was that close, because it sends a strong message to the Iranians that we really do have a robust capability and that they need to take that very seriously going forward. So now both sides have stepped back from the brink. We've got a little decision space today. It will be really interesting to see how that plays out.",

First he said that, well, once he felt like the jig was up, he said, well, I helped her to escape. And then he said that two African-American men had taken both of them and he witnessed her murder. And then the third and final story was that she came at him, she tried to attack him. That`s when he was really grasping at straws and said that she tried to attack him with scissors and he ducked out of the way, she ran into a wooden post and killed herself by crashing into that wooden post.

I don't think the answer to that question, but the fact that I can even ask that question shows how interconnected the Trump empire is and that Michael Cohen does not just represent the Stormy Daniels side of the problems for Donald Trump but the whole mess. The Russian, the money, and the sex scandals. So this is a big story that <I THINK> we're -- I mean, let me say this. To the extent the story has changed so much in just 24 hours, the extent of how much money Michael Cohen was making, <I THINK> this story is going to be ongoing for the next couple of days."

The Sunnis have long objected to that. They want this entire conversation sidelined until a new government comes into power. We understand negotiations -- sorry -- are taking place as we speak now with the prime minister, with the president, and with Sunni negotiators to see if there is any wording that can bring all three sides, the Kurds, the Shia and the Sunnis, on board with this constitution.

The Sunnis, <OF COURSE>, do have the votes to reject this constitution and the referendum to come by mid October.

Because those systems were turned off, because the plane made that very deliberate left hand turn in between the air traffic control of Malaysia and Vietnam, so nobody really noticed right away that it made that left-hand turn towards the Indian Ocean. And the passengers, by all accounts, perhaps remained in their seats for some time. They would have realized they weren't headed north to China which was their destination. Why did they remain seated? Did something happen in the cockpit? Did the pilots maybe come on the intercom system and give some reassuring message?

Right down the street, just out of the camera is the national court building that the special court that investigates terrorism. Has a bulletproof courtroom. This is a judge in that courtroom, according to the interior minister who has ordered the arrest and these other two men to be interrogated. We have been told basically since late Thursday, early Friday, soon after the bombing, that there were suspicions, according to a lot of people from political parties, people in the streets, Spanish journalists they suspected this two- track ETA and possibly Islamic terrorist, that maybe the government wasn't coming clean. And you see the result right here. People are really expressing their anger. If last night those huge demonstrations across Spain, everybody closing ranks, paying homage to the victims and against the terrorism, no matter what strike, tonight you have pure hard politics in the streets.

Now Harry Reid, one of the main players in all of this for the Democrats has said that the U.S. risks a credit downgrade once again at present. Now America currently has a credit rating of AA+. It was downgraded, as I say, for the first time in history two years ago by Standards and Poor. The move came four days after congress actually reached a last minute deal to raise the debt ceiling. Currently there are only 14 countries in the world with the top AAA rating. America now on par with Austria and France. The big three credit ratings have declined to comment on Harry Reid's remarks. How significant would a downgrade at this stage be for the United States?",

But if they were to downgrade, and if underline, because we don't know if they will -- but if they were to downgrade, it will be consequential. Why? Because of the plumbing of the system. <I THINK> what politicians don't understand is the plumbing of the system is based on the fact that the U.S. is a AAA. So I'll give you an example. If the U.S. gets downgraded across the board, then you cannot exchange collateral easy, which is a fancy way of saying that the system gets clogged up, which means people with cash can't allow the cash into the system because they're not getting anything back.

We have a bunch of other deadlines that are coming up. But I do share Mick's sentiment -- Mick served with me in the Budget Committee, which is we can't take nothing for an answer and we cannot allow the status quo on health care. Health care costs are skyrocketing. People are losing choices. The bill that we passed in the House, the whole premise of the bill is to lower premiums and give people more choices. Look, the way I think that matters the most is we believe risk pools are very effective. We had a very, very good high risk pool in Wisconsin. And so when I take -- talk about risk pools, what do I mean when I say that? We believe, as government, federal government, state government, we should fund the care for people with catastrophic illnesses, so that if you get a catastrophic illness, like cancer or heart disease, you don't go broke paying for that health care. And by having direct care in subsidies, like we had in our risk pool in Wisconsin, for people with catastrophic illnesses, you dramatically lower the price of insurance for everybody else. Ten percent of the people in the Wisconsin risk pool, 10 percent of the people were in the risk pool in Wisconsin, the other 90 percent of Wisconsinites in the individual market had much cheaper, much more affordable health care with more choices and lower premiums. That's what we're proposing to do. Have funds for catastrophic illnesses so those people get support. One percent of the people in the individual market drive 23 percent of the costs. So if we basically say we will directly support those -- I don't know -- 8 percent to 10 percent of Americans who have a catastrophic illness, then the insurers only have to fund up to the catastrophic amount, insure up to there. So it's like property and casualty. I mean, we've got the best quarterback in America, Aaron Rodgers, selling us insurance with discount double check. We got a lizard selling us Geico Insurance. Why can't we do it that way with health insurance? And that is basically what we are proposing. So I think what we have offered, make sure that we fulfill the objective we all want: Affordability, accessibility, and making sure that people with pre- existing conditions get good health care at an affordable rate without going broke if they get sick. That is what we're trying to achieve, and that is why we can't take doing nothing for an answer.",

        "statement": "<WELL>, the E.U. report claims that 11 E.U. countries knew about these secret CIA flights and that they knew that the CIA was operating secret prisons in Europe. Now, this report is not legally binding. But some of the information they came up with is interesting. They were given significant logs in terms of the flights and exactly where they happened. There were more than 1,200 of these flights, in fact. Germany had 336. The United Kingdom, 170; Portugal, 91; Spain, 68; Italy, 46; Ireland, 147. I mean, these were a lot of flights, mainly conducted in 2003 and 2004. What is interesting here is that the European Union has called on these individual governments to launch their own investigations, mainly because they don't have the power to investigate further. It seems highly unlikely that any of these countries will do so. They will take cover under national security, saying that they won't be allowed to divulge this. There has been speculation that, in fact, a secret CIA prison was operating in both Poland and Romania. President Bush, back in September, admitted that these CIA prisons did exist. And, although they don't have any detainees in them right now, he wouldn't rule out the fact they would be used again in the future. This has really been an issue nagging at the European parliament. <I THINK> they don't want to have the taint of these kinds of secret clandestine transfers, interrogations, hanging over Europe. And so they have pushed this issue through to the parliament. As I said, there is absolutely nothing that is legally binding about this. This issue, though, will continue to grind on in the European parliament. They expect to go through this report. As I said, it's only a draft report. They expect to go through it early in the new year. Paula Newton, CNN, London."

It's not clear whether they'll all be U.S. citizens. <OF COURSE>, all of those diplomatic missions employ a mixture of Russian nationals and U.S. nationals. But whichever way you cut it, this is a major step by the Russians and it underlines just how angry and disappointed the Kremlin is to this U.S. sanctions bill passed so convincingly in the U.S. Congress.

        "statement": "\"Keeping Them Honest\" tonight: Are efforts to skim the oil being snarled by government red tape, or is BP trying to slow the skimming and disperse the oil instead to limit its liability? Allegations tonight of both tonight. We are here at the Audubon Aquatic Center sea turtle rehabilitation program. They have got a dolphin here, and they have got sea turtles, more than 100 sea turtles. We will show you how those sea turtles are being treated, how their lives are being saved, the oil cleaned off, and what's going to happen to them once this disaster is finally over. We will have that later in the program. This is day 71, the oil still gushing into the Gulf, still flooding ashore, Tropical Storm Alex churning the waters, making them too rough to skim for oil. The Coast Guard today ordering those skimmers, those boats specially designed to collect oil off the surface, skimming it off the surface, ordering those boats back into port until the sea calms down. The fact is, you don't need a tropical storm to stymie the skimming. Long before the wind picked up here, it was already tangled in red tape. We are \"Keeping Them Honest\" -- people down here demanding to know, where is the sense of urgency? I mean, we saw the exact same thing during Katrina, emergency work hampered by people operating from the non-emergency rule books, rules that maybe made sense or might make sense or could have made sense in normal times that seem to make no sense now. Take these skimmers, for instance. There are 433 of them, according to \"The Times Picayune,\" the local paper in New Orleans. According to the paper, there are more than 1,600 skimmers available elsewhere in the continental United States. They need every skimmer they can get down here, so why not use some of those? <WELL>, it turns out the 1990 Oil Pollution Act requires many of them to be standing by in case of other spills elsewhere. But you would probably say, <WELL>, <LOOK>, the nation's worst environmental disaster is unfolding right here right now. And what does the federal government say to that? <WELL>, not much. Admiral Thad Allen, last week, morning than two months into the disaster, saying that working around the 1990 law is -- and I quote -- \"a work in progress.\" Is that what you would say if this country is being attacked? Meantime, new waves of oil hitting the shore in Mississippi and Florida, new beach closings in both states, and officials closing the inlet into Pensacola Bay, as a six-square-mile sheet of thick reddish oil patches getting closer. So, what about foreign countries offering up their skimming vessels? <WELL>, it turns out there's a law against that, too, the Jones Act of 1920, intended to prevent foreign ships from taking part in American domestic trade, taking cargo from one American port to the other. The law being interpreted to mean that foreign skimmers cannot pick up oil within three miles of shore, because that's considered a port and dump it -- a port onshore. As of last week, six vessels have applied for waivers to the Jones Act. None has been granted. Other foreign skimmers are working outside the three-mile limit, kept out by red tape. But are they also being stopped by BP to hide the true size of the spill? Tomorrow, a Dallas investment banker is scheduled to testify before a Senate committee. His name is Fred McCallister. He's from a company called Allegiance Capital. He says he's been trying to broker a deal with BP to bring 12 large skimmers from Greece. He made the offer two weeks ago, first believed BP didn't respond because of the Jones Act. Now he's questioning BP's motive, and he's expected to tell the Senate committee tomorrow that BP is trying to disperse and sink the oil, instead of skimming, to serve -- his words -- its own financial interests. Fred McCallister joins us now. Fred, why do you think that BP would prefer to use dispersants over skimmers?"

        "previous_statement": "Yes, it is so sad. All right. Well, we appreciate the reporting. CNN's Chris Lawrence, live from Las Vegas this morning. Hunting for a serial pedophile suspect. The international police organization Interpol finally identified this man. They're not releasing the name, but The Associated Press says he is 32-year-old Christopher Paul Neil (ph). He's a Canadian. He is suspected of having sex with at least 12 young boys. The pictures posted on the Internet. His face was digitally altered, but Interpol was able to reverse that effect to get an accurate picture. Police say he worked as an English teacher in South Korea but he is now believed to be somewhere in Thailand. Rapper T.I. will be spending the week in jail. A federal judge ordering him held in custody until a Friday bond hearing. T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, is facing federal gun charges. Authorities say he gave a bodyguard $12,000 to buy three machine guns and two silencers. Police say they found three more guns in his car and six other guns at his suburban Atlanta house. Harris is a convicted felon and not allowed to own guns. His attorney says there are two sides to every story. He says he's confident the legal system will \"work in T.I.'s favor\". Rapper T.I. accused of illegally buying those weapons. Guns and violence part of the hip-hop package? An expert will be talking to us a little bit more about this in the NEWSROOM in just a few moments. Meanwhile, back in class in Cleveland, Ohio, this morning. The high school where 14-year-old Asa Coon went on a shooting rampage last week is open again. Four people were wounded before the young gunman took his own life last Wednesday. Today, students and teachers were cheered as they entered SuccessTech Academy. Big security changes there. An armed security guard is on duty this morning, and students now have to walk through metal detectors. I want to show you some of these pictures. Trouble in Texas, as you can see. Wind and rain pound the northern part of the state, causing flooding and damage. A driver, in fact, was killed when his car slid into a big rig on a wet road in Denton, Texas. A number of other accidents, as well, also blamed on the storm. And a group of golfers in Garland had to be rescued when a creek suddenly spilled over. A reprieve today, but more bad weather could head to the region tomorrow. Rivers on the rise across Iowa. Heavy weekend rains causing flooding in Iowa. More than four inches, in fact, pounded some areas. The biggest problems in western and central parts of the state. Montgomery County has been declared a disaster area. No word of anyone hurt in the flooding, but more storms could roll in tomorrow. So Rob Marciano, who is in the weather center for us now, let's start there. How do things look for folks in the Midwest coming up?",
        "statement": "<WELL>, we've got, as you mentioned, another couple of rounds of storms to deal with. Not so much today, but there are still high rivers, in some cases flooding around Des Moines, Iowa, down the Nebraska-Missouri border, in through Kansas. Also some flood warnings around there. So this is a system that brought that rainfall and severe weather. It's lifting to the north, kind of losing its punch. Stretching out. So that's good news for folks kind of downstream of this, but bad news for folks who really could use some of the rainfall, notably across the Southeast. So there is a problem there. A bit of a catch-22, I suppose. But Michigan, down through Dayton, Cincinnati, Covington, Lexington, a little bit of Louisville, seeing some action. But then you get toward Nashville and it starts to dry out, as does the moisture plume. Nashville, east towards Chattanooga, Knoxville, northern parts of Georgia, that's where we need the rain. It doesn't <LOOK> like we're going to get it. Here is a storm system that's going to come into play tomorrow. <ACTUALLY> for the next several days. An area of low pressure will dive across the Rocky Mountains. Once it gets over the Rockies, it will pick up some energy. They typically do this time of year. They kind of stretch their legs and start to wind up. Then tapping moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. And unlike other storms that have tried to formulate -- form this past fall, this one's going to have some better dynamics. It will get a little bit stronger and it will also, because of that, tap more moisture. So strong storms potential for tomorrow, and again on Thursday, too, as this thing really begins to wind itself up. So tomorrow we're talking across the Plains here and toward Tornado Alley. And then on Thursday, we're talking more widespread, across the Mississippi River Alley and in through parts of the Southeast. That's where we might get some rainfall, but with that rainfall on Thursday or Friday, Heidi, comes the threat for damaging, severe storms. So you don't always get the gentle, longstanding rainfall that you need to relieve a drought, but at this point..."

No, I have not seen the bill. I don't think most members of the Senate have seen the bill. There has not been one public hearing on a bill that impacts one-sixth of the American economy and every single American. You have a process in which the bills brought forth are opposed by the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the AARP, every major health care organization in America and they're trying to push this through. So you're quite right in saying this whole process has been totally bananas. And the answer to it, and McCain made this point the other day in his speech, which I'm sure you heard, is you've got to go back to what we call normal order, regular order. And that means you have the committees discuss this bill in a bipartisan manner. We try to improve the Affordable Care Act, not destroy it. That's what the American people want.",
        "statement": "OK. So, from what we understand, the bill as it is, which by the way <I THINK> is worth discussing on some level because it is very possible it passes the Senate and then even though senators are voting for it saying that it stinks and should never become law the House decides to pass it and send to the President does not put it into conference.

There was some pretty vicious here, coming from many Iranian politicians who were saying that this is all, as you say, lies and deceit. They called this a campaign maneuver by the Israeli prime minister. And the other big narrative, they're pushing here in Tehran, is they say that this will create a rift between Israel and its western European allies. And <OF COURSE>, especially between Israel and the U.S. There were some commentators last night who were saying that this is a humiliation for the Obama administration and for the president in particular. It's interesting this morning, because there was <ACTUALLY> a press conference just a couple of minutes ago from the foreign ministry, where they now said that they don't care about what Benjamin Netanyahu said in his speech.

The chances that someone would die get smaller and smaller. Now let's take a <LOOK> and compare skin anthrax and inhalation anthrax. Let's <LOOK> at some of the similarities and differences. Skin anthrax is not rare. I can't, again, give numbers but there have been many, many people on farms throughout the years who have gotten anthrax infections in their skin from handling animals who have anthrax. They are given antibiotics and usually everything is okay. Inhalation anthrax on the other hand is rare. In the 20th century in the U.S. there were only 18 cases. Now let's <LOOK> at the outlook. For skin anthrax with antibiotics the out <LOOK> is good. For inhalation anthrax, the outlook depends on severity. It depends at what point in the illness the symptoms are given. If it's given before symptoms even show up because they caught it so early, the outlook is really pretty good. If it's given after symptoms show up then the out <LOOK> is not as good."

So given that all eyes in Iraq at the moment are on Tikrit, where, <OF COURSE>, there is Iranian involvement and a contribution to that effort.

As far as the situation in Tikrit goes, Iraqi forces which are essentially led by the Shi'a paramilitary forces with the Iraqi army and police playing a supporting role do seem to be making significant progress. We saw at the frontlines of smoldering ISIS vehicles, bodies around them that had been hit just a day before yesterday. In three days, in fact, these Iraqi forces had managed to advance 50 miles to the very edge of Tikrit. When we were there, they were just one mile to the east of the center of the city. Yes, there is an Iranian role being played there. I had the opportunity to speak to four Iranian advisers at the front line. They described themselves as volunteers. What we did hear from the Iraqi commanders is that yes, they say they're proud and happy to have the Iranian advisers on the ground helping them. One of them telling me it is better to have four Iranian advisors on the frontline than 400 American advisors sitting in the green zone in Baghdad -- Christine."

I believe we have live pictures in fact of the hospital site at Copiapo, Chile, where the miners are expected to be ferried. In fact, first reports suggested that four miners had left Camp Hope. The community immediately surrounding the mine for better medical care at this hospital. The last report we had said that two of the miners were believed to be aboard that helicopter. And once again this has been one of the possibilities that was foreseen by the rescue team in the enormous planning that went into this operation. They knew from the outset that some of the men would need beyond the cursory initial examination that they're receiving immediately on the surface. More sophisticated medical care, that was to be available at a hospital where they were to be flown in the event it was needed. The word we have is in fact two of the men are being flown to that hospital. We're looking at live pictures as we wait to see them arrive. The helicopters were at the ready. The weather was good for flying. Of course nighttime is not the time of choice for helicopter pilots. But the pilots were equipped with night vision goggles. Traffic along the route was dramatically cut back. The roads were blocked so that the night vision goggles wouldn't find ambient light from headlights interrupting the pilots' ability to see and fly. Authorities basically did everything they could in the expectation that some of these men would need medical care right away. The indication we have is that in fact two of the men are being choppered to the nearby hospital. We'll have more details on this as soon as we get them. Let's pause briefly, though, to bring you up to speed on some of the other headlines that we are watching around the world at this hour. In Hungary, crews are working as fast as they can to build temporary dams to hold back 500,000 cubic meters of poisonous sludge. Major cracks have formed in the retaining loss standing between local villages and the toxic mess. Last week a flood from the same reservoir killed eight people. In Lebanon, Iran's president is scheduled to visit on Wednesday. In fact I believe he's arrived. We have some pictures there. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is expected to stop in the southern part of the country which could mean the Iranian leader will tour the Israeli border. Mr. Ahmadinejad will also meet with Lebanese leaders during his trip. Hezbollah, of course, a very close ally of the Tehran government. In Washington, the Obama administration is giving the green light to deepwater oil drilling once again. Oil rig operations were ordered to stop following the BP oil spill last April. Only oil well rig operators following newer tougher regulations will be allowed, though, to resume their drilling. In England the judge is expected to rule today on the controversial sale of the Liverpool football club. The current American owners are trying to block Liverpool's chairman from selling the embattled team to another American owner. A Singapore-based billionaire, he is also offering to pay $570 million in cash for the club. Rosemary?",

And that <OF COURSE> includes getting them ready to get up there. And after being pulled out the miners will be evaluated at the site before being taken to a hospital in nearby Copiapo.

CNN has learned that Lay has lost more than $100 million since the end of August, including more than 60 percent of the shares of Enron stock he once owned. What a change. In the past, Lay loaded up on Enron stock. Even as he was cashing in on lucrative stock options, Lay was buying more than he was selling. In late 1998, Lay reported owning fewer than a million shares. But, toward the end of 1999, that had increased to nearly 2 million. Even as the stock price soared from $25 a share to more than $40. And he would add nearly a million more after that, as the price spiked to $80 and $90. He was still buying as late as last August. And stayed bullish. August 20th and 21st, Lay bought a total of 93,620 shares for his portfolio, as he reported on this form to the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the very same time, August 21st, Lay predicted, \"a significantly higher stock price,\" in an e-mail to a group of employees. In September, he told employees, he'd been buying and they should do the same. In an e-mail chat, he called Enron stock, \"an incredible bargain,\" at the current price of around $30 a share. A \"great opportunity, incredibly cheap.\" (on camera): Lay reported his Enron holdings back then at 2.9 million shares of Enron stock. But, then disaster. Lay's attorney, Earl Silbert, told CNN that by late November, as Enron was slipping into bankruptcy, Lay owned only 1.1 million shares of Enron stock. That's a drop of 1.8 million shares. That's 62 percent of Lay's holdings. (voice-over): Silbert told CNN, and others, that Lay lost the shares because he's use them as collateral for money he'd borrowed from Enron. And when Enron's stock price sagged, Lay turned the shares over to the company rather than pay back the cash. How much has Lay lost? The value of the stock Lay said he owned in august was $101 million, at the time, when it was selling for $35 a share. The current value of what's left, at a recently quoted price of 67 cents a share, is well under a million. Lay's loss on Enron stock alone? $100 million. Lay is hardly a poor man. But, in November, he put two houses in Aspen, Colorado, up for sale, asking around $15 million. (on camera): And this much is clear from the record, so far. Lay bought more shares than he sold on the way up and lost a ton when the price collapsed. Brooks Jackson, CNN, Washington.",

It was an extraordinary day and <I THINK> any of us who watched it unfold will remember it. <I THINK> if I were 100 years from now and a biographer, I would start with that day and then you could unpack the relationship between the son and the father, who happens to become presidents. What was good and what was troubling about the presidency, but that that moment captured a moment in time that is so fitting for our moment today."

One on those lines connects former Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, to Russian billionaire named Oleg Deripaska. Just today, Russian President Vladimir Putin was asked about the possibility Deripaska appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss his relationship with Mr. Manafort. Putin say, \"That's his right. Let him do it.\" We don't know if the Senate Intelligence Committee actually plans or if they want to talk to Mr. Deripaska.

He's <WELL>-known to Russian President Vladimir Putin and has been given awards by the Russian government. There is no indication Donald Trump has ever met Oleg Deripaska, but it turns out the two men do have connections. CNN has learned Donald Trump and Oleg Deripaska's company have over the years shared the same attorney, his name is Mark Kasowitz. And on his website, Kasowitz prominently list President Donald Trump as a client, who he's represented in a \"wide range of litigation matters for over 15 years.\" Oleg Deripaska isn't on Kasowitz list of clients, but records show Kasowitz is the attorney in a federal lawsuit where he represents an investment vehicle wholly owned by Deripaska, just one attorney with two billionaire clients, perhaps. But consider this. Oleg Deripaska has another shoestring connection to Donald Trump and it's tied to this man. Donald Trump's former campaign chief, Paul Manafort. Manafort and Deripaska are former business partners. The Republican strategist who ran Trump's campaign for five months also started several offshore companies with Oleg Deripaska. Legal filing show the Russian billionaire entrusted nearly $19 million to Manafort in 2008, the money to be invested in the Ukrainian telecom business. It was part of a major deal to make \"significant long term capital.\" But the investment and relationship fell apart. For several years, Deripaska tried to contact Manafort and get answers about the missing money. Court papers filed in 2014 showed Deripaska's attorneys had not been able to reach Manafort and determined Paul Manafort had simply disappeared. Then, Paul Manafort began running Donald Trump's campaign in 2016 and Deripaska's legal claims against him appeared to have gone away. Manafort spokesman tells CNN, \"Mr. Manafort believes the matter is dormant and will not be pursued further.\" Ethics expert and CNN Contributor Larry Noble says while there may be nothing inherently wrong with Kasowitz representing both Trump and Deripaska in unrelated matters --"

The point is start looking for it early. <I THINK> what happens too often, especially in this country, is these risk factors are only identified after someone already develops heart disease. Most doctors tell you, it's too late. Identify these risk factors early. Cigarette smoking is the most modifiable risk factor, probably the biggest culprit. If you can quit smoking, you'll cut down your risk of heart disease, 36 percent reduction in deaths among heart disease patients just from smoking alone. Also, we talk about blood pressure a little bit as <WELL>. Let me just give you the numbers real quick. Below 120 is what is considered ideal blood pressure.

Two things, one is the fact that this deal, this deal that's on the table now, that some people are actually saying that it isn't the final deal, that perhaps an extension is in the works and two, bring us up-to-date on the future of Theresa May?",
        "statement": "Wow, two big questions, Paula, starting with the first one. When we're looking at it deal, it's important that we distinguish between two parts. We have the withdrawal agreement, that's essentially the divorce. Matters relating to some of money that Britain is going to pay the EU around 39 billion pounds to leave, how they are going to handle avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland, and issues like citizens' rights. So that is the divorce part. That's the 585-page document that we got last week. Now, that draft text is all but agreed and I've heard from sources in the EU and also sources in Parliament that that is pretty much a done deal. It's taken them so long to negotiate that part of it. No, the other section of this deal is the political declaration on the future relationship. Now at the moment, I've re-read that just a few moments <ACTUALLY>. It's around eight pages. That gives an overview of what the EU and UK envisage themselves to be like in the future. So how will they trade? What will their security relationship be? How will they conduct foreign affairs with each other? All of these types of issues. Now, that has the potential to be fleshed out. So when people talk about sweetening the deal, a lot of the time, they're referring to trying to add some flesh on the bones of that political declaration because then, people wouldn't feel as much that they were signing up to this deal of 39 billion pounds being handed over to the EU without knowing exactly what Britain was going to get in return or a so-called blind Brexit, which is a really big concern of remainers and pragmatists in the middle here. It's only real Brexiteers that feel we could crash out with a no deal or leave the European Union and we wouldn't have as many of the negative side effects as other people envisage."

        "statement": "Not yet, but this is still just coming out. We have reached out to the top republican on the House Oversight Committee, Jim Jordan, to see if they share a concern. According to this democratic letter, the republican staff and democratic staff were involved in these questions with this woman, Tricia Newbold. Now, <OF COURSE>, this has been an issue in the news, as you mentioned, Jim. We have reported that Ivanka Trump's security clearance was an issue for some officials, including the former White House Chief of Staff. But the President came in and overruled those concerns. The New York Times reported about Jared Kushner's security clearance concerns being overridden also by the President. The President has the authority, <OF COURSE>, to do that under the law, but the concerns that are raised in this letter and by this whistleblower is that the process for overruling, the concerns are essentially disregarded, that personal security files have not been closely in check and that interim security clearances also have been given out to people who probably should not have gotten the security clearances at the end of the day, so all those things will be questions for this committee going forward."

They're going to carry computers to cross reference data they find in the field, and they're even going to be able to send real-time from the field photographs and other information back to New York and Vienna for analysis there.

Now these fans are saying that what happened was this was the revenge of the police. They just stood back and let the Port Said fans go after them with rocks, with sticks and stones.

The only time the only time the two nations met at a World Cup was in the finals in 2002, actually, where Brazil won two-nil. This time, Brazil are the unlikely underdogs, it's got to be said, facing the possibility of being booted out of the World Cup in their own front yard. Germany on the other hand are playing their fourth consecutive World Cup semifinal. Frederik Pleitgen is in Rio, and he joins us now with the latest. Brazil's poster boy, Neymar, won't play against German after, of course, suffering a serious injury. So, I know you've been out and about. Are German fans feeling confident?",

The interesting thing is, we're about four hours before the match, as you said. If you <LOOK> down here, you'll scarcely find a single German fan out here. It's a sea of yellow, if you will, with the occasional German fan sprinkled in every once in a while. The Germans, however, not confident at all. The Germans that I've spoken to, they say they have maybe a 50-50 chance of possibly winning this thing. They've seen the performance of their team so far in this World Cup, they feel it's been an up-and-down World Cup for them. They had some very good matches, like the last one against France, but also some very bad ones, like the one before that against Algeria. And if you talk to the Brazilian fans, they'll see that their team needs to play as a team to compensate for the fact that they've lost their star player, Neymar, and won't be without their regular captain, Thiago Silva, as <WELL>. Nevertheless, I do sense some confidence among the Brazilian fans. They say they do think that with the support of the crowd, with the support of the nation, they can pull this thing off. Apparently, a company here in Belo Horizonte has even started somewhat of an action here. It's given out 60,000 Neymar masks just to assure the team that at least in spirit, everyone in this town will be a Neymar in some way, shape or form. So, very little confidence on both sides, but a lot of hope on both sides, I would say. And I have to say, the fans are very, very fair and very good to each other. I always hear the Brazilians say they love the Germans. I always hear the Germans say they love Brazil, they love the way this World Cup is being conducted. So it is, if you will, a match of two titans in the football world, but certain two where the fans respect each other and the teams respect each other as <WELL>, Becky."

But what's stunning is while the president is tweeting and bemoaning reports of any kind of chaos in the West Wing, he's in part sowing some of that chaos himself by setting up this argument between his former communications director and his current chief of staff.

He was held hostage at gunpoint by Somali pirates. Navy SEAL snipers rescued him yesterday. They killed three of his kidnappers. The fourth one was captured. Breaking news also this morning out of Bangkok where Thai soldiers are clashing with protesters blocking roads in the capital. Seventy people reported injured. The demonstrations come just a day after Thailand's ousted prime minister called for a revolution. And the average price of gas down a bit this morning to $2.05 a gallon. That's half the record high we hit last summer. Prices are nearly a dime though over what they were three weeks ago. New Jersey has the cheapest gas in the nation, $1.87 a gallon. And right now, the latest developments on the end of this five- day hostage crisis in the Indian Ocean. American ship captain, Richard Phillips, is free and he's in good health this morning, resting comfortably on a U.S. warship. He was rescued Sunday. Navy SEAL snipers killing three Somali pirates who took him hostage. A fourth kidnapper is in U.S. custody and he could spend the rest of his life in a U.S. prison. Somali pirates already holding more than a dozen ships and 200 hostages still are now vowing to retaliate. Shane Murphy was second in command on board the Maersk Alabama when Captain Phillips was kidnapped. His father, Joseph, knows a thing or two about the pirates who confronted his son's ship. In fact, he teaches a course on anti-piracy tactics at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. Jason Carroll brought us inside the lifeboat. He's been covering the story since this hostage crisis unfolded, and he joins us live now from outside of the academy in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts this morning. Good morning, Jason.

Our meeting was enlightening. And I <LOOK> forward to working closely with you in the coming years to deepen the friendship, understanding and bilateral ties between the United States and Israel. I also recall our meeting in the city hall when you and I were strolling around the beautiful building at the terrace of the sixth floor watching the walls of the city of Jerusalem. At that time, you were the governor; I was the mayor. And <I THINK> none of us thought that the day would come that I would have the honor and the privilege of being hosted by you as president of the United States and prime minister of Israel. I could sense, then, your deep connection to the Holy Land and your friendship and commitment to the state of Israel. I must say, Mr. President, that my instincts did not fail me. I and the entire people of Israel appreciate your true friendship and unwavering commitment to Israel's security and its <WELL>-being as a vibrant Jewish state. Your involvement in the Middle East and personal contribution to the effort toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been significant. The vision which you outlined in your historic speech of June 2002 of two democratic states living side by side in peace and security is the basis of any progress toward a solution in this region. Your unreserved support of the disengagement plan and your letter of April 14th, 2004, to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon -- and I join you in praying for his recovery -- were the basis for the success of its implementation. What you immediately recognized to be a historic step was later adopted by all those who were skeptical in the beginning. I intend to exhaust every possibility to promote peace with the Palestinians according to the road map, and I extend my hand in peace to Mahmoud Abbas, the elected president of the Palestinian Authority. I hope he will take the necessary steps which he committed to in order to move forward. Unfortunately, the rise of Hamas, a terrorist organization which refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist and regards terrorism as a legitimate tool, severely undermines the possibility of promoting a genuine peace process. As you stated, Mr. President, the Palestinian Authority headed by Hamas government must abandon the path of terrorism, dismantle the terror infrastructure, honor agreements and recognize Israel's right to exist. By doing so, they will find us a willing partner in peace. However, we will not enter into any kind of partnership with a party which refuses to recognize our right to live in peace and security. Despite our sincere desire for negotiations, we cannot wait indefinitely for the Palestinians to change. We cannot be held hostage by a terrorist entity which refuses to change or to promote dialogue. If we come to the conclusion that no progress is possible, we will be compelled to try a different route. I have presented to the president ideas which I believe could help advance his vision and prevent a political stalemate. According to these ideas, we will remove most of the settlements which are not part of the major Israeli population centers in Judea and Samaria. The settlements within the population centers would remain under Israeli control and become part of the state of Israel as part of the final status agreement. This process of realignment would reduce friction between Israelis and Palestinians, ensure territorial contiguity for the Palestinians, and guarantee Israel's security as a Jewish state with the borders it desires. The implementation of these ideas would only be possible with the comprehensive support of the United States and the international community. I anticipate working with you to explore ways to advance this. We discussed the Iranian issue. The Iranian regime, which calls for Israel's destruction, openly denies the Holocaust and views the United States as its enemy, makes every effort to implement its fundamentalist religious ideologies and blatantly disregards the demands of the international community. The Iranian threat is not only a threat to Israel; it is a threat to the stability of the Middle East and the entire world. And it could mark the beginning of a dangerous and irresponsible arms race in the Middle East. Mr. President, we appreciate your efforts to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions, including through the U.N. Security Council. They are of crucial importance. The international community cannot tolerate a situation where a regime with a radical ideology and a long tradition of irresponsible conduct becomes a nuclear weapons state. This is a moment of truth. It is still not too late to prevent it from happening. I thank you again for your gracious hospitality and for our discussions. I <LOOK> forward to continue working with you, Mr. President. Thank you very much."

(Crowd Cheers) For all of the veterans here in El Paso, a community that has distinguished itself in service to country going back to Marcelino Serna in World War I, an undocumented immigrant who went over to France with the U.S. Army and came back the most highly decorated veteran from the state of Texas, to the Bolanos brothers in Vietnam, to every man and every woman who right now has their life on the line for this country, if we truly appreciate your service not only will we make sure that we make the investments in the V.A. to care for you when you return from having born the battle especially for those conditions connected to service in combat, posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, we will also ensure that there is a roof over the head of every single veteran who's sleeping on the streets tonight. (Crowd Cheers) And then if we really mean it, if we really mean it, we will ensure that this country does not start yet another war before every peaceful, diplomatic, nonviolent alternative is explored and pursued and those wars that we ask our fellow Americans, these service members to fight on our behalf, 17 years and counting in Afghanistan, 27 years and counting in Iraq, let's bring these wars to a close and bring these service members back home to their families, to their communities, and to their country. (Crowd Cheers) If, after 300 years, after the enlightenment, we can still <LISTEN> to and believe the scientists, and I for one do, who tell us that thanks to our own emissions, our own excesses and our own inaction this planet has warmed one degree Celsius just since 1980, and the fires and the floods and the droughts and the man made natural disasters will only get worse if this planet warms another degree Celsius and this is our moment with little more than ten years to spare to do everything in our power to free this economy from a dependence on fossil fuels, greenhouse gas emissions, (Crowd Cheers) and to ensure as we make the investment in new technologies and renewable energy that everyone has the chance to benefit from this new economy, especially those communities lower income and too often of color that have borne the brunt of climate change so far, this country has shown that we can do it. When the western world faced the existential threat of Nazi Germany more than 80 years ago, this country harnessed the political will of hundreds of millions here of the western democracies not only to win that war for the following 80 years to make this world safe for democracy and to lift millions in this country into the middle class. This is our opportunity right now to do something for a far greater existential threat, to do more not just for those here with us today but for the people of the future, our kids and grandkids and every generation that succeeds them. (Crowd Cheers) We have to once again reassert our role on the world stage in order to do this, but if we're going to do that, we've got to strengthen these historic friendships and alliances, so many of them forged in sacrifice, the service of men and women who put their lives on the line and lost their lives to this country. Let's make sure that that sacrifice was not squandered. Let's make sure that we strengthen those alliances. Let's end these love affairs with dictators and strong men all over the world. (Crowd Cheers) Let's earn - let's earn the respect of the people around the world, not just by how we treat those in other countries but how we treat those within our country. (Crowd Cheers) And how we treat those at the border of our country. If we do that, we can make sure that we once again become the indispensable nation convening the other nations of this planet around some of our shared challenges like climate change, like nuclear disarmament, like ending all these wars that we are currently engaged in. We can do for ourselves what no other country can and we have an opportunity at this moment to reprioritize this hemisphere, those countries and people who are literally connected to us by land. We can try to solve the problems of Central America. We can invest in the opportunities to help the people of Central America where they are at home. It is our choice. (Crowd Cheers) But to do any of this, we've got to understand that our country's success depends on the success of this democracy. It is the single greatest mechanism that humankind has ever devised to call forth the power, the potential and the genius of a people around their challenges and their opportunities and so every single citizen must be able to vote and every vote must count. (Crowd Cheers) As president, I will sign into law a new Voting Rights Act. Together we will end gerrymandering. (Crowd Cheers) We will get big money out of our politics (Crowd Cheers) and all across this country we will have automatic and same-day voter registration. That's how we're going to do it. (Crowd Cheers) A full political democracy is only possible if we vigorously pursue a true economic democracy. Every child, every man, every woman in this country must be able to see a future for themselves in this country. Otherwise this country will have no future as a democracy. That means that this extraordinary, unprecedented concentration of wealth and power and privilege must be broken apart and opportunity must be shared with all."

It's sort of in the Vatican, it's considered inappropriate to be working on the Lord's Day. I think it's indicative of how much significance the Pope Francis attaches to this undertaking that he was able to set aside protocol like that. I mean, you mentioned that this will not be the first papal visit to Cuba. John Paul first went in '96, Benedict XVI in 2012. But the difference, Victor, this is the first papal visit after the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba. That, of course, happened last December. Both President Obama and President Raul Castro of Cuba have said it would not have happened without the pope's personal diplomatic involvement. So, this is the kind of pivotal moment in which Cuba is attempting to sort of retake its place in the community of nations and mend fences, particularly with its most important relationship in the hemisphere. I think Francis, the history's first pope from Latin America, believes he has a pivotal role to play in that process. And so, you can bet he is taking this trip very seriously. I think it's worth saying that stop in Cuba is going to come en route to France's first visit to the United States in late September when he will be in Washington, New York, and Philadelphia. I think, symbolically, he wanted that stop in Cuba to be packaged with the stop in the United States. In essence he is making a statement that these two countries are fated to be in a relationship.",

        "previous_statement": "Should be a good one. All right. Christine, thanks. We're also getting our first look this morning at Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. These are the first pictures released since she was shot in the head back in January. It's pretty remarkable to see how great she looks, how almost normal, completely normal, despite nearly fatal gunshot wound pointblank to the head. Two new pictures of Giffords were posted on her Facebook page. In one, she's with her mother, that's the one seen there. And then the other, she's alone. Her hair is shorter and darker and she has a big smile on her face. There does appear to be a slight indentation on the left side of her head. That is where the bullet entered. Giffords' chief of staff says that he expect her to leave a Houston rehab facility by the end of the month and begin outpatient treatment. A lot of people wondering though what her future holds. Will she be able to resume life as it was before the shooting? Coming up at 7:10 Eastern, we're going to be speaking with Dr. Sanjay Gupta about his assessment of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords' progress. The 20-year-old nephew of Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings has been shot and has been killed in a shooting in his Virginia apartment. Christopher Cummings was a student at Old Dominion University. He was found in his off-campus home Friday morning. One of his roommates was also shot and critically wounded. Police have not released any other details of what may have happened. The power is out, the phone lines are down, after three earthquakes rock the New Zealand city of Christchurch. Now you'll remember it's the very same city hit by another devastating quake almost four months ago. More than 180 people were killed in that earthquake. Police telling CNN that there was some damage caused by the shocks which struck within two hours of each other. There were also a few injuries, but officials say they're not serious. Seven thousand people allowed to return home in Arizona, but authorities say it's at your own risk. The second largest wildfire in the state's history is now only 10 percent contained. Evacuation orders were lifted over the weekend in two towns, Springerville and Eagar. Authorities are still warning the elderly, those with health problems and very young children should stay away because of the lingering smoke. This fire has burned an area twice the size of New York City in the past 15 days, and spot fires have spread to New Mexico. Rob Marciano is in the Extreme Weather Center for us. As we said, 10 percent containment. Are they going to have weather on their side today as they go back at it?",
        "statement": "Weather will be a little tougher today but <I THINK> the next couple of days they may have another shot at seeing more tranquil weather, see the winds die down a little bit. Still bad air quality west of the fire and east also into Albuquerque and we have a fire weather watch that's posted for parts of New Mexico and Texas today. Critical fire danger in these areas including New Mexico and just the eastern edge of that fire which is, it is pressing towards the New Mexican border, that's for sure. Winds today expected 20 to 25 miles an hour with gusting -- gust winds to 35. All right. The rest of the country we've got storms that are expected across the midsection. Contingencies really cool across the northeast with unsettled weather after a cool and at times wet weekend. OK, but it's better than the heat you had last week. The heat is going to continue across the southeast until further notice. 101 expected in Dallas. We had a slew of record highs. We'll go over those in about a half an hour. So we continue to sweat it out here. I hope you enjoyed your cooler weather. I see Christine with her rain jacket on up there. Very fall like across New England. Back to you guys."

European law enforcement officials say they now have hard evidence linking shoe bomb suspect, Richard Reid, to one of Osama bin Laden's European cells. We'll have a live report on this in just a moment. U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan are at the site where suspected al Qaeda members were killed in a missile attack. A remotely-controlled predator spy plane fired a missile at a group of people on Monday. Officials say at least three were killed, including one who may have been a senior al Qaeda leader. Police in Karachi, Pakistan, say kidnapped \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter, Daniel Pearl, was lured into a trap by a series of e-mails. The e-mails promised an interview with a militant linked to shoe bomb suspect, Richard Reid. Three men detained for questioning this week were formally charged today with kidnapping Pearl. Members of a Senate committee expect that the former Enron chief, Kenneth Lay, will testify before Congress next week. However, Lay's spokeswoman says Lay has not made up his mind. Earlier indications were that Lay would take the fifth amendment, but senators say that does not appear to be the case now. Lay was subpoenaed to testify after he canceled a scheduled appearance this week. And just a few more hours before the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, President Bush will be on hand, as <WELL> as thousands of athletes from around the world, and the largest security force ever in the history of the Games.

But if, President Trump's administration wants to use foreign policy; the issue of the South China Sea, to kind of bully them in - from the time he's selected into a discussion. That's going to be a non-stative; they'll talk on trade - on trade's term, but not deal with this according to the South China Sea which they have a very long standing and forth-right approach to.

So Dan, 2007, this was the first Eric Trump Golf Tournament took place raising $220,000. It seemed like a really great formula. A free Trump golf course and the goods and services were all donated assuring donors that every penny possible went to charity. But after about four years things change and I just want to read part of your piece and I'm going to let you weigh in, OK? You said, \"In reviewing filings from the Eric Trump Foundation and other charities, it's clear that the course wasn't free, that the Trump organization received payments for its use, part of more than $1.2 million that has no documented recipients past the Trump Organization. Golf charity experts say the listed expenses defy any reasonable cost justification for a one-day golf tournament.\" So explain this, where did the money go?",

I know this is for kids of cancer. But you're holding this in my course and we're going to charge you. And so they are charging him. And you can see the expenses go up immediately when he does that. And they continue to inflate over the years, keep on creeping up, keep on creeping up. And as that's going on the accounting that the foundation is doing doesn't make much sense. They list one golf tournament every year and the numbers seem too high to be just one golf tournament. And then you have former board members who are saying <WELL>, sometimes we would count other events that we worked with, some years we wouldn't. But they always only listed as one event. There's a lot of murkiness there. The one thing that we know is that Donald Trump's company is getting paid by his son's charity."

This morning, as states across the country push ahead with reopening, 19 states are now seeing a spike in new cases of coronavirus, states such as Texas and Florida, both in fact breaking records for new cases. Notable that both were late to shut down and quick to reopen. Despite those recent rises, President Trump is still planning to hold a large campaign rally with thousands of people packed, as he said, shoulder to shoulder, inside -- and that's crucial -- inside arenas across the country. This will begin next week in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but those wanting to attend will have to sign a waiver agreeing not to sue the campaign or the venue if they indeed contract the virus while at the event, notable there. And new this Morning, the president is, again, defending his D.C. church photo-op last week that saw, and you can see the video there, peaceful protesters forcibly removed from Lafayette Square by U.S. and military police. This even as top military commanders distancing themselves, apologizing for joining the president in that photo-op, the latest example of the president digging in even as the country is showing signs of tangible cultural change. We've got all the angles covered this morning around the country. First, let's go to Florida, CNN's Rosa Flores on coronavirus cases rising there. Tell us about the numbers and, crucially, tell us about the governor's response. Is this changing his thinking on reopening?",
        "statement": "<YOU KNOW>, he was asked about that yesterday, and he did not quite answer that question, Jim. But as you mentioned, he is talking about uptick in cases here in the State of Florida. According to Governor Ron DeSantis, he says that the uptick is due to outbreak in cases in agricultural communities, in areas like Collier County and also Palm Beach County, where according to the governor in some areas, up to 50 percent of the people who are tested test positive for the coronavirus. Now, despite this uptick, the governor is recommending the reopening of schools in the fall. Now, a reporter asked him that question also. How can you reopen schools safely given this uptick? And the governor mentioned a few things. He said, among other things, that hospitalizations in the state are flat, that the risk to children is low, and then he mentioned this. Take a <LISTEN>."

And I would not be surprised if what we find is that it was <ACTUALLY> the closing arguments that really tipped the scales of justice in the direction of a death sentence because the prosecution had such a masterful close and really drove home beyond a reasonable doubt the fact that Tsarnaev knew exactly what he was doing. In fact, he stood behind that Martin Richard's family for minutes, knowing full <WELL> where he was before he placed that bomb. And they ended, Brooke, after, <YOU KNOW>, this riveting testimony with images and videos. And so, we talk about the fact that these families have had to live through so much. <WELL>, this jury relived over and over and over again the devastation, the horror, the terror, the murders that Tsarnaev inflicted on not only the city of Boston, but over 200 victims of his terrorist act. And <I THINK> at the end of the day, it was the overwhelming just visual, visceral, detailed, awful evidence that they could not turn away from.

We had protests and riots in 1992. Even the National Guard of California has called that, by the Governor, by the President. A fundamental principle of America is federalism, and the most quintessentially local responsibility is public order and safety. The people of California, the people of Portland, Oakland, they can handle this.

United has waved their change fees for anybody wanting to alter their travel plans because as this system moves forward, we're expecting it to hit around 4:00 this afternoon. It's going to be nasty with blizzards -- a blizzard, high winds, and also heavy, heavy snow.

So, what you're seeing on your screen right now is one of these World Cup games, and you're seeing people who are in different parts of the world, and you can hear them and see them as you're watching the game. So, instead of gathering around the couch, Becky, you in Cairo, me here in New York, we could just gather around our laptops and watch the game this way. It's a web extension for a web browser right now, not a mobile app yet, but a web extension. And so, you can talk, you can type, and you can celebrate the game."

U.S. and Mexican officials meeting in Laredo, Texas to discuss the relentless drug gang violence that has gripped the border and forced American travel warnings in the northern parts of Mexico. Mexican officials briefly sent troops to Nuevo Laredo last year, after a surge of drug-gang related murders. Those troops, however, were quickly pulled out. Drug-gang violence is back and in control of the town. In Tijuana, yesterday, suspected drug gang hit men shot and killed a police officer. The United States is warning now all Americans to take extreme caution when traveling to Mexico as this, quote, \"brutal violence is escalating.\" Americans are being urged to avoid Oaxaca completely. Demonstrators in the province are trying to overthrow the local government. Five people have been killed during the violent protests. Aides to Mexican president-elect, Felipe Calderon, this week said, ending the crises in Oaxaca will be his biggest challenge when he does take office. Calderon is set to take office in December despite continued claim by the opposition that he stole the election. Still ahead here Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson says his talks with the Communist Chinese government, a complete success. A complete success for whom? We'll examine the answer to that question.

We're at the Hiram Wadsworth Pumping Plant just outside of Hemet, California, a very big day here today as the first new hydroelectric generation to come online in six years comes online right here in about an hour here just outside of Hemet. What is happening? Well, water that normally goes through some of these pumps is in fact going to be going through what has been now been converted into turbines. Four of the pumps here have been converted into turbines. As water rushes through, they will turn and generate electricity. Where is the water coming from? Let me take you outside and give you view of Diamond Valley Lake. This is an 800,000 acre feet manmade lake. This water comes to us here in southern California from the Colorado River through a series of aqueducts and canals. And that water normally is pumped from those canals and those aqueducts into the system via these pumps. These pumps take the water from aqueducts and canals and pumps that water up into the lake. Well, today that process is reversed in the case of at least four of these pumps. They've become turbines. The water will be coming through from lake back through these turbines. That will generate some electricity. Here to explain some more about this Phillip Pace. He's the chairman of the board of the Metropolitan Water District. Mr. Pace, tell us what you are doing here today.",

I believe it's something like half or two-thirds of all of the songs that get played on Canadian radio have to be considered Canadian cultural content. And if I remember it correctly, it's the singer, the songwriter and the producer. Two of the three have to be Canadians. And this, <OF COURSE>, has created a big boom in Canadian producers. So it's the similar thing, where you think it's going to be very visible, kind of on-screen ways and it's going to work also for behind the screens more. And I don't see any reason why it couldn't work for those -- the only reason it's expected not to work for the Grammys is the Grammys has less of an effect on the music market than the Oscars do on the film market.

And <I THINK> that's got to be part of the equation.

Children learn from these social experiences. <OF COURSE>, the mother is important, but few people in this country believe that only the mother is important.

Whatever the substance of the Russia collusion, Trump in the estimation of his senior staff did not have the discipline to navigate a tough investigation nor the credibility to attract the caliber of lawyers he would need to help him. At least nine major law firms had turned down an invitation to represent the president. Josh, that's new.",

We do know there that refugees have been returning to the city amid continuing firefights between Marines and insurgent cells. Only yesterday the Marines told us that three Marines had been killed in fighting in al Ambob (ph) Province. That's the province that Mr. Rumsfeld is in now. <OF COURSE> earlier in the day his first stop was the city of Mosul. He flew in there under cover of darkness and visited Camp Marez. That was the scene of Tuesday's devastating explosion. He met troops there. He also visited the hospital facility that had treated the wounded from Tuesday's blast. From there it was on to the city of Tikrit where he met soldiers from the 1st Infantry Division. Little of real substance in terms of announcements coming out of these meetings, but the trip is certainly important for the troops in terms of boosting their morale. One might also suggest that it's important for Mr. Rumsfeld's own political image since his stewardship of the war in Iraq has come under criticism. What he has said, though, is that he believes this insurgency in Iraq can be defeated. He didn't put any timeline on it, but he urged the naysayers to have a little more faith and that the job would get done. And that's certainly what he urged the troops to do, to keep on doing their job -- Carol."

Checking our top stories at 27 minutes past. More than 100,000 acres have already burned in the Idaho wilderness and firefighters are working tirelessly to protect 5,000 homes near Sun Valley from going up into flames. Lightning sparked the fire more than two weeks ago. It's one of nine big fires burning across Idaho. But in the southeast, the problem is too much water, more rain and flooding expected this week. Six inches of rain fell in southern Mississippi on Sunday turning roads into rivers. Flooding has not been this bad since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In England, outrage grows after the partner of newspaper reporter Glenn Greenwald is detained under a UK terrorism act. David Miranda, that's him on the left, was released after nine hours of questioning. This is according to the \"Guardian\" newspaper. No charges were filed but Miranda's computer, cell phone and other items were confiscated. Greenwald, who's on the right, works for the \"Guardian\" newspaper and broke the story about the secret surveillance programs in the United States. Miranda was traveling from Germany to Brazil when he was stopped. In money news, a new week of trading on Wall Street and stocks are expected to open flat. Investors take a breath following two weeks of losses. Ringing the opening bell this morning, by the way, representatives from American corporate partners, nonprofits and helps veterans transition to civilian jobs. There they are, just about to ring the bell. One-on-one with the future king.

Let's start with the tragic, and it concerns the death, the assassination, the killing of a right-wing politician in The Netherlands. Now, this is an extraordinary case. It concerns Pim Fortuyn, who was a right-wing politician. The Netherlands is due to go to the polls later this week. And he was basically gunned down in the street in Holland. Why this was extraordinary was because he was right-wing, he was himself gay and he was <ACTUALLY> -- had a huge amount of support. What we have been learning about politics in The Netherlands in the last week is that his policies were anti-immigration. He was anti-Muslim in many cases. And he was garnering an enormous amount of support. Now, he has been assassinated. What everybody is looking at is to see whether Dutch voters, when they go to the polls, will <ACTUALLY> take this far-right turn. So that was very much big news across the continent, because <OF COURSE>, it followed on from the other -- it followed on from the election in France, where the other right-wing candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen. So that's the tragic side of the week that we have been covering and we've all been talking about in Europe. The happy side, or at least the happy ending was the baby who was snatched -- she was one of twins, and she was snatched from the maternity unit of a local hospital. Basically what a teenager did was walk into the hospital and walk out with a baby. A teenager was arrested. Now, why this is particularly interesting, Jack, is that several years ago, the rules were supposed to be tightened to prevent exactly this sort of thing from happening. It didn't happen, and journalists across the country have been going in and out of hospitals pretending to be parents, not walking out with babies, but just proving that, <OF COURSE>, it can be done. The bizarre, one was not amused, Mr. Cafferty, at least according to her majesty. <LOOK>, if you -- this could disturb your breakfast. Be careful, be very careful. This was the man who decided to streak in front of the queen. All right? Now, <LOOK>, just to make it clear, that's the queen, that's the streaker. Remember: queen, streaker, just in case you are getting a little bit confused. He ran for 50 yards next to the queen's car. She was apparently not amused. Prince Philip thought it was all a great hoot. But this is the best thing (ph). He was then rugby tackled. Now, imagine being rugby tackled by police officers, thrown over the barrier, thrown onto the floor with your privates, and I don't mean the police officers, on the concrete."

I was with government officials when word came in that the \"Carl Vinson\" was heading back to this region. And they called it just another provocative act by the United States. This government believes that the U.S. is the reason why they have to build nuclear weapons. Why they need a viable intercontinental ballistic missile with a nuclear tip capable of reaching the mainland U.S. Because their government tells them that these weapons of mass destruction are essentially the key to their survival as a nation. And that the United States would rain bombs down on their homes here in Pyongyang if their country doesn't develop these weapons. And they explain that is why people live in economic hardship. Why many people don't have enough electricity or have insufficient food at times. They say that these are the sacrifices that they must make in order to develop weapons, to protect this country and to protect the North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un. This is a big week for Kim. The Supreme People's Assembly happening tomorrow, the annual political gathering where delegates will vote in favor of what the leader presents before them. And then on Saturday, it's the biggest holiday of the year here in North Korea, the day of the son celebrating the birthday of North Korea's founder. Around this particular holiday, North Korea in the past has engaged in what the world considers very provocative behavior including five years ago when they attempted and failed to launch a satellite into orbit. U.S. and South Korean officials looking at the latest satellite data believe that North Korea could push the button on its sixth nuclear test at any time. And that certainly would be a way for Kim Jong-un to send a very strong message to the United States, a message of defiance on a week when he wants to project power and strength both here in North Korea and also to his enemies around the world.

It, also, of course, would come at the orders of President Obama. What we do know is the U.S. military already has one unit on very short notice. This is the Commanders In-extremis Force. It's at an undisclosed location, Special Forces that can move within four hours of getting that presidential order, specializing in hostage rescue and terrorism operations. There are a number of other units in the region. Let's walk through some of them, Wolf. There are about 150 Marines in Sigonella, Italy, not very far away. They are trained for crisis intervention. There are also two teams of Marines in Rota, Spain, also trained for anti-terrorism operations. And back in the United States, the legendary and often called upon SEAL Team Six, the Army's Delta Force, based on the East Coast of the United States, they are always on the short stream. That four hour typical notice, they could be wheels up if the order comes. But, Wolf, you are right, what the military will be doing is putting some pieces into place so they are ready.

We are unfortunately unable to give further details about this situation, the ongoing response or the remaining 12 Statoil employees. This is with regards to the safety of those involved.\" And, Barbara, we also have a statement now from the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Mike Rogers. And I'll put it up on the screen. It's a statement on the kidnapping of Americans in Algeria. I'll read it to our viewers. We don't have it ready for the screen. \"The kidnapping of Americans and other Westerners in Algeria brazenly raises the stakes in an already very volatile region. Militant groups and terrorists with ties to AQIM, Al Qaeda in the Maghreb, are becoming increasingly brash in their activities. The Obama administration needs to have a clear and focused policy on eliminating the threats that diverse al Qaeda affiliated groups pose to the United States and to Americans working abroad off of the usual battlefields.\" The statement goes on. This is from Mike Rogers, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. \"Additionally, this administration needs to better understand the specific threats posed by AQIM and other al Qaeda-affiliated groups. If we don't deal with these militant groups and terrorists swiftly and effectively, they will only pose an increasing threat in the future, as they already have in Benghazi, and now Algeria and Mali.\" That statement from the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Suddenly, Northwest Africa is the latest front in the terror war. Jihadists say the gas field attack is a response to Algeria's support for a French anti-terror offensive in neighboring Mali, where an al Qaeda group has made some major, major gains. Brian Todd is taking a closer <LOOK> at what's going on there -- Brian, you've got some good perspective."

She was very clear and she said that these people were very happy to see them, to see the President, to see the first lady. She felt as though that the President brought comfort to many of the victims there at Miami Valley Hospital. And so I think there's a little bit of confusion as to why the President said that the Mayor and Senator Brown were lying. I can tell you that the Mayor was very critical, very frustrated with the overall visit in terms of the President's non-response to trying to get something concrete, some sort of commitment from the President in terms of what if anything that he would do about gun safety legislation going forward. She made it very clear that she was very frustrated that that subject was brought up over and over again and the President said at one point, \"Yes, we're going to do something,\" but was not specific about what that something would be. And so perhaps the President was upset about the Mayor revealing that. We'll have to go back to the President and asked him about that. But in terms of his response to the victims that they were there, she was very clear that the victims were happy to see him.",

And Toluse, I'm sorry, I know I didn't get that quite correctly. I will endeavor again. David, before leaving for Dayton, Trump said he wanted to stay out of the Political fray. Are you saying surprised that he did what he did? He refers to 0 percent failed presidential candidate Sherrod Brown in a tweet and he has now just did that in El Paso again when meeting with first responders talking about Brown."

He initially sort of had it all to himself. But I can tell you, Wolf, talking to voters here, Ben Carson's candidacy is more serious in Iowa than any Republican would have expected. He is tapping into the support of evangelical Republicans, those key Christian conservative activists, who are important to the Iowa caucuses, the home-schoolers, others like that. So Donald Trump knows that he has to keep an eye on Ben Carson.

Probably just one more Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee than Democrats. So if they lose one in committee, it could get trouble for Tillerson getting to the floor. That being said, guys, it would be an enormous blow to the president if his own party somehow blocked his choice for secretary of state just coming out of the gate.

But even Trump's critics are failing to note what to me as a lawyer is the real significants that what he said would be admissible evidence in a variety of legal contexts of his state of mind as evidence of his past behavior and of his character. What makes this stand out from all of his prior profanity, inanity, insanity, malignancy and repugnancy is that this time he <ACTUALLY> admits sexual predatory conduct with -- which if it had come out of the mouth of say Bill Cosby, would be used in the criminal trial against him.

You might say there that that was almost a yellow light. Earlier in the day, the administration said it would give Prime Minister Sharon no advice. The president there saying Israel is a sovereign nation. It will decide what to do. But he did urge the prime minister to keep in mind, quote, \"his vision of peace\" when he decides how to respond.

And from the president just there, Lou, very rare words of praise for Yasser Arafat.

We don't know that. In any case, lots of questions asked there, none answered. And so the relevant moment remains this rather dramatic and somewhat painful appearance of 28-year-old Amber Frey, who says that she met Scott Peterson on the 20th of November. That would be just a bit more than a month before Mr. Peterson's wife disappeared. That she was told he was unmarried, that they had a romantic relationship. Then she paused and expressed her sorrow to Ms. Peterson's family. David Mattingly has been covering the story for us, and David is outside. I gather that's the police station, the city hall in Modesto, David?"

If they can get him down to like 1,150, 1,120, then we've got a real game. And so, that's what's going on behind the scenes. In public, what we've seen is a total shift of rhetoric with Ted Cruz now acknowledging that rather than get 1,237 before the convention, he's going to try to get it at convention.

Susan Collins, Murkowski would be opportunities perhaps to get one Republican vote and sink the nomination.

Move in, push them out of the towns and villages, get them out of their strongholds, and give them no place to come back to. Because while the fighting is going on, U.S. troops will also be offering aid, reconstruction and assistance to the people in this area.

Donald says \"prepare for Brexit plus, plus,\" as he puts it. Let's take a look at where we are. You have to say advantage Clinton heading into the vote count tomorrow, why? Because she has this four point lead in our poll of polls, that's a bigger lead than President Obama had over Mitt Romney four years ago. It's a bigger lead than George W. Bush ahead of John Kerry back in 2004 the last time the republicans won the White here. So you have to say here advantage Clinton. Now we pick president state by state, we've talked about that quite a bit so let's look at some of these key states, these four especially getting a lot of attention on the final days. In North Carolina, Clinton plus two, gettable for Trump, but Clinton advantage. Florida has been a dead heat to the end. The closest state back in 2012, guess what, we're going down to the wire in Florida. Again, Pennsylvania, again getting attention today, Clinton plus five there. That gets harder for Donald Trump that's why he's pushing so hard for those blue collar votes. Tonight, New Hampshire, Clinton plus three. Again, Donald Trump back in New Hampshire tonight tried to get the white working class to reverse the Clinton leads in those states. So, it's a big challenge for Trump. Let's look at the scenarios in terms of the road to 270. Here is where we stand in the CNN electoral count, 268 for Clinton, 204 for Trump. Even most republicans in Nevada concede because of all the early voting, we could take this one probably out of the tossup and give it to Clinton. Now this is significant, Don, because that gets to over to finish line 274. What can Donald Trump do to win? Well, let's start first with the democrat's scenario. Some democrats think this is actually conceivable. Democrats think Donald Trump will probably get Arizona in the end. But the democrats actually think especially because of early voting and superior organization. They can do one, two, and three. That would be a blowout, 322 for Clinton, 215 for Trump, not included in this map one from a congressional district here and one from a congressional district there in Nebraska. But if this scenario played out it's a blowout for Clinton. However, here is Trump's biggest, if you will, more reasonable scenario. Number one win Florida, number two, win North Carolina, number three try to win New Hampshire, that gets him to 263. At that point he just needs to turn a blue. It could be Pennsylvania, it could be Michigan, it could be Wisconsin, just needs to turn one of the blues he's been targeting. Let's assume though for the sake of argument that Clinton takes New Hampshire, then Donald Trump, Pennsylvania would be enough. Michigan would be enough in that scenario, but here we go, Don. Let's make it a little more worse case for Donald Trump. What if Clinton wins North Carolina. Trump takes Florida but Clinton takes North Carolina. This is where it gets tough for Trump, 293 to 244 to that scenario. What Donald Trump would have to do then is take Pennsylvania, New Hampshire wouldn't be enough. See, let's go there. Then it's not enough unless he wins both of the congressional districts. So the challenge for Trump could be in the end to do one and two. Now democrats say that's unreasonable, 1988, in 1988, the last time those two states went democratic. So, democrats say we head into the final day with an advantage. But Trump path to 270 they believe are unreasonable, but Trump says he's going to surprise us, Don, Brexit, Brexit, we'll be counting them this time tomorrow.",

The polls are coming fast and furious, you heard John King there talking about the national outlook, at least the battleground states outlook, the Electoral College. Five national polls were released today, all showing Clinton up by several points. It looks really close. But as John King just said, in 2012, Barack Obama was tied with Mitt Romney in the last CNN poll, and in 2008, Barack Obama was four points ahead of John McCain before the election. So, is four points a big lead or is it a small one?"

U.S. sources have confirmed that the laboratory -- some of the pictures here show what they found -- had instructions for making anthrax, formulas and ingredients for explosives and chemical blood agents, including something called hydrochloric acid and sodium cyanide. Together that makes hydrogen cyanide, a so-called blood agent. These are chemicals that can be combined together to make toxic agents. But in Iraq, U.S. military officials are stressing that so far they have found no evidence of actual chemical weapons themselves being made or manufactured at this site. They are not yet calling this a chemical weapons lab. Now, the national -- the Iraqi national security adviser spoke about all of this yesterday."

They took care of 70,000 COVID patients over a few months, one of the busiest hospital systems for COVID. And he shared with me that they took care of all these patients, their health care workers actually getting COVID at a very low rate, lower than the general population. Think about that Erica, health care workers in hospitals inside taking care of COVID patients, COVID is circulating and they have a lower rate of infection than the general population. Why is that? Masks. They were wearing masks. It makes a huge difference.

Congress is about to pass an increase in the federal debt celling, the amount that government is allowed to borrow and run up into debt. Here's where you served in the Clinton administration, back in 1993, and you look at it; it goes from $4.37 trillion up to $12.1 trillion, the government now authorized to borrow. And Congress is going to raise that up a bit even more; $1.4 trillion, record budget deficit last year. And yet, Larry Summers, even as families around the country have to cut their budgets or make concessions, Congress is going to vote today on a spending bill that will give some Cabinet agencies, a dozen Cabinet agencies, sometimes nine, sometimes 10, and some departments, as much as a 12 percent spending increase. This administration says next year will be the focus and discipline on debt reduction. Why not draw a line now and say now we need to start, and that's too much spending?",
        "statement": "A couple points, John. First, if people study your graph slowly, carefully, they'll see that the debt was <ACTUALLY> going down in the late years of the Clinton administration. Frankly, when a new administration took place in 2001, all the innovations came off; we spent; we did, for example, a whole new prescription drug program, paying for none of it, and at the same time we launched massive tax cuts. And that's why the 10-year deficit projection that President Obama inherited was $8 trillion. That's what happened. And President Obama recognizes that we've got an obligation to fix it. Frankly, for the next year or two, priority number one -- certainly this year, priority number one has to be job creation. That's why we're putting people directly to work. But then the priority has to be getting the country's finances under control. That's going to be very clear in the rigorous budget that the president proposes. That's clear in how the president, with the very strong support of Secretary Geithner, has administered the -- the TARP program. Just this week we were able to announce that more than $200 billion improvement in the projection on that program. We're starting to collect the funds back with interest and dividends on a substantial scale. The Bank of America, for example, paid back some $45 billion that's now available for taxpayers. We're very focused. The president has said that, on health care, we are not going to put into place -- he is not going to sign any legislation that increases the deficit at all. And in fact, the legislation provides a framework that will enable significant budget cuts."

The judge in this case, Lloyd Nash has said that he intends to appoint an independent counsel to come in and speak to Caldwell. The person that he specifically plans to appoint is Steve Sitcoff (ph) , a defense attorney here in town who has represented Aaron Sorkin (ph) in the past, in drug-related charges. Earl Caldwell objected to that, so the exact person who will be chosen remains to be seen. The prosecution had also hoped in a separate motion to remove William Jordan, a private investigator who is assisting the defense team.

        "statement": "<WELL>, they don't know for definite whether he didn't have any help. What they are saying here, Victor, is that they don't have any evidence of him having any help.

So what they've said is, they've seen him alone, passing through the stations of Turin, and then, through the main central station in Milan from where he managed to -- seems to catch a bus, and end up in this rather random carpark outside another local train station. The big question from here is, where was he heading from here. <WELL>, we know that buses do depart from this carpark towards the Balkans. We know that there are jihadist networks operating in the Balkans. But they also leave for Southern Italy. And remember that Anis Amri arrived in Southern Italy when he first stepped foot in Europe. He spent four years in a jail in Sicily, and members of his own family had speculated that he might have been radicalized in that very jail in the South of Italy. So was he heading south? Was he heading back to his native Tunisia? We don't know that either. I can tell you that buses depart for places like Algeria and Morocco from this parking lot. I saw one depart yesterday evening. Those are the kinds of lines of investigation that authorities will be trying to piece together from here. But no evidence at the moment that he had any help. When it comes to what he had on his person, they also say that his belongings were rather scarce. He had three pairs of trousers, one on top of another, and he had a backpack. Inside that backpack, he had no cell phone, no credit cards -- just over $1,000 in local currency, in euro, in cash. And so, they're trying to figure out where was he going, had he just managed to grab those belongings, and headed on the run."

They talked about a possible legislative program for the next year, should there be a Bush administration. But, <YOU KNOW>, that meeting also was to give a public impression that this is a confident campaign that is preparing for the future. At the same time they've -- they're creating a Web site to take applications for positions in a Bush administration, saying that they're looking for a very hard-working, effective people in the future. And then the governor's surrogates, both Andy Card was on the talk shows yesterday, running mate Dick Cheney was on the morning talk shows as <WELL>, saying that he thinks it is time for the vice president to give up, to concede defeat, that there have been enough counts of the Florida votes, and it's time to bring this all to an end.

We're watching for an important vote in New York City; it could happen at any minute. It's a commission there that governs the city's landmarks. Basically they will decide if an Islamic center and mosque in lower Manhattan will go forward. The building is just two blocks from Ground Zero.

Seven of the commissioners have already said they will not vote for landmark status. There are 11 commissioners. That means the building two blocks north of the World Trade Center slated to be an Islamic center and mosque will not -- will not receive landmark status. What does that mean? It <ACTUALLY> means that the developer will be able to knock the building down and go forward with whatever plans he has, and the plans right now call for an Islamic Center that will contain a mosque. As <YOU KNOW>, there's been tremendous opposition, but it is important to note also that that is not what these commissioners have been deciding. They have been weighing the architectural and the historic merit of the building. (on camera): Seven of them thus far has said it does not rise to the level of landmark here in New York City, and, so, again, the decision here is going to be no landmark status. The developer, Sojo Properties, can move forward and do whatever it wants with the building, and the plans in the past have called for a building at least 13 stories high, an Islamic center that would contain a mosque."

But now there's a brand-new threat going forward and that's flooding. I want to show you some pictures of some of the flooding we've been experiencing across the Midwest. And you'll see that we definitely are looking at more wet weather occurring. This is some areas across parts of Missouri, Cape Girardeau in southeast Missouri. And unfortunately, this is a very, very dangerous situation because more rain is expected in the forecast. You can see on our map here, not only do we have flood advisories, but our computer models are putting some very heavy rain just to the south. Here's Cape Girardeau right here. It's north of Memphis. And then Little Rock also getting slammed with lots and lots of rain. This is the last thing they need. The flooding has been very severe across much of this region, so we're tracking some very wet weather across Arkansas, and you can even see into parts of Texas. Unfortunately, the rain's coming into a part of Texas that doesn't need it as much as areas to the west. So that's what we're looking at there. And as you can see here, we are also tracking some strong thunderstorms across much of northern Minnesota. And then on the back side of the system into the northern plains, it's a blizzard.

And furthermore, the thing that the Americans keep hammering is that they believe that there is a definite link between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. The British don't necessarily believe that there is exact evidence for that, and Prime Minister Blair told the Parliament that just this week. So what they're hoping, and the message that the British tell us that they're sending to the Americans at this point is that when Colin Powell goes to the Security Council, the evidence he lays out must be compelling, must not be able to backfire. Because if it does that could leave them a worse position. But Blair saying to us, Just wait for next week. <OBVIOUSLY> British Intelligence, he told us, is helping the Americans in terms of the evidence they present to the Security Council.

Intermittent rain showers here. But the real concern over there. Not even 100 miles east of where I am, Hurricane Dorian, the most powerful storm ever to make landfall in the Atlantic basin is over Grand Bahama Island right now, causing devastation.

The storm is inching through the Bahamas, and the concern is what happens then. Again, over my shoulder now, just about 50 miles, it's expected to take a turn to the north. But if it wobbles, if it drifts, it could have a devastating impact here on the Florida coast, as <WELL>. Even if it doesn't move from its projected path, hurricane-force winds expected up and down the Florida coast, not to mention Georgia and South Carolina, as <WELL>. There are hurricane warnings already in several counties in Florida, including where I am right now. That means they can expect the power of a hurricane. Storm surge warnings, as <WELL>. Where I'm standing, they're expecting a storm surge of 4 to 6 feet. It's low tide right now. Very likely that where I'm standing will be covered in water as this storm moves up the Florida coast. Mandatory evacuations underway in several Florida counties. A little bit later today, they will declare mandatory evacuations in Georgia and South Carolina, as <WELL>. We're going to stay on this all morning long, because the forecast is so very crucial. There really hasn't even been a storm like Hurricane Dorian.

Notice, it goes right over Barbuda and when you <<<THINK>>> <ABOUT> these storms, of course, they're essentially like a top on a table. If there's any <<SORT OF>> imperfection on the table, you'll notice the top begin to wobble <A LITTLE> bit. As it interacts in Barbuda, we're seeing <A LITTLE> bit of symmetry lost in that storm. The wind speeds, they're not going to be diminished by much, 185-mile-per-hour, essentially at theoretical limit of how strong storms can get on our planet, when you <<<THINK>>> <ABOUT> that. There's oceanic and atmospheric conditions that can allow these storms to get to a <CERTAIN> magnitude, <ABOUT> 190, 195 is <<<BELIEVE>>> to be at the top of the limit, and this storm, of course, sitting just shy of that. So, here's the forecast. We <<<THINK>>> it <<COULD>> skirt the northern portion of Puerto Rico as we approach later on this evening, <AROUND> 8:00, 9:00 p.m. tonight local time, and then beyond Thursday into parts of the Dominican Republic, eventually direct impact possible <AROUND> the Turks and Caicos. But the storm system itself so significantly large here that some of these islands will be swallowed by the eye of the storm as it crosses over the land masses. So, this is going to be a devastating storm across some of these regions. In <FACT>, once you approached a category 4, exceed that into a category 5, this is signified as catastrophic by the National Hurricane Center. And this storm is so strong guys, if there was a theoretical category six, <EVERY> 21 miles per hour or so is when categories switch up from one to another. If there was a theoretical six, this <WOULD> be up there, 157 being required for a 5 sitting at 185. And incredibly, you can actually strengthen <A LITTLE> bit as <WELL> over the next few hours here because the environmental conditions are as such. The big <QUESTION> as we approach Friday into Saturday. This storm looks <<LIKELY>> it will approach <AROUND> eastern Cuba. The model guidance has been very <<CONFIDENT>> in that. But notice as you approach this time <PERIOD> into this weekend, there's variations. The models do want to shift the track <A LITTLE> farther back to the east. That <WOULD> potentially if this verifies with the heaviest concentration being on the coast, that <WOULD> potentially <TAKE> some of the major cities of eastern Florida out of direct impact because the strongest winds <WOULD> be on the right side of this storm system, but then if you're tuned in across parts of Georgia into the Carolinas, Savannah, and Charleston, that is where the threat <<COULD>> be far, far higher. But again at this point, four days out from that point, we are looking at significant variations but now favoring the eastern side of Florida as more of a <<LIKELY>> scenario, guys."

For decades the Turkish state has been at war with the PKK designated a terrorist organization not just by Turkey but also the E.U. and the United states. This is the largest scale and ground defensive since the 1990s. Turkey says it's just trying to protect the borders and stop the Kurdish PKK fighters from moving into Syria. In October of last year, Turkey invaded neighboring northern Syria, going after a related Kurdish group called the YPG, a sister organization to the PKK. What makes this situation so adorning is that the Kurdish force turkey attacked in Syria makes up the bulk of the fighting forces partnering with the U.S. and the battles against ISIS. The Americans abandon their Kurdish allies withdrawing from key positions. The Turks swept it, tens of thousands of civilians fled.

They're dating in groups, which is healthy. There's been some press about how kids shouldn't be hanging out in big groups all the time, it's preventing them from developing relationships. That's hogwash. It's positive that they are learning social skills.",

Certainly, James Comey, the FBI director, indicated that he left the interactions and immediately tried to memorialize them in these memos that he's since shared. That's the only way we know what might have happened is from those conversations and if the president ever gives under oath a response to that and is ever questioned by the committees on the Hill or by the FBI and Robert Mueller, the special counsel. Those are -- that's how we'll get to the bottom of what exactly happened, whether or not the firing of James Comey -- that's really the big question here. That's what the tweet was about. Whether or not the firing of James Comey was an attempt to interfere with an ongoing FBI investigation. That's something that is still very much ripe in the air for us to answer.

And this is the Wynn Hotel Casino where CNN's debate gets under way in just 10 and a half hours.

And, you <KNOW>, there are <DEFINITELY> some strategies that are being put into place. Make no -- make no mistake <ABOUT> this. Bernie Sanders walks into tonight's debate with a lot of Democrats inside the party wondering, is this somebody who <<COULD>> be elected president of the United States? Yes, he has fired up that liberal base of the Democratic Party and so he is going into tonight's debate with a strategy. And that is essentially not attack, to get his message out. He wants to talk <ABOUT> Wall Street, he wants to talk <ABOUT> the economy, he wants to talk <ABOUT> the environment. But his advisers weren't listening. If Bernie Sanders attacked, you will <<FEEL>> the Bern, so to speak. He will attack if he's attacked. Now Hillary Clinton, it's <<SORT OF>> a different strategy for her. She has not debated since 2008. And so for Hillary Clinton, really, it's <ABOUT> not making any mistakes at this point. A senior aide to Hillary Clinton says she wants to cut through the politics. You <KNOW>, she has been really saddled these last several months with questions <ABOUT> Benghazi and the e-mail controversy, so she wants to break through <ALL> of that noise and finally start talking <ABOUT> these issues that she's been wanting to talk <ABOUT> with Democratic voters on a big stage and in front of a big audience. And so that's Hillary Clinton's objective tonight. And Carol, as for the other candidates, Martin O'Malley, Lincoln Chafee, Jim Webb, you <KNOW>, they are not just the other runs. They're not just the other people on the stage. With <ONLY> five candidates, keep in mind, Martin O'Malley who is just struggling to show up above zero percent in the polls, he's going to be positioned right next to Hillary Clinton on stage. And if you look back to the GOP debate that CNN just had out in California, you <KNOW>, there were moments for Carly Fiorina. There were moments for Marco Rubio. And those moments translated into a big boost in the poll numbers for those two candidates. Martin O'Malley, Lincoln Chafee, Jim Webb, they're looking for the same <THING> to happen tonight. Political fortunes can <CHANGE> here in Las Vegas. But for Hillary Clinton -- you <KNOW>, the other <THING> that I thought was fascinating, Carol, Hillary Clinton, when she landed here in Las Vegas, she was not training her sights on her Democratic rivals. Especially Bernie Sanders. She went straight to Donald Trump's hotel, which is just right over here."

They're telling us that at least 21 have been killed today, hundreds injured. This on a day that Arab League observers are set to start arriving to try to help end the violence there. While it's hard to authenticate videos, there are more videos emerging on sites like YouTube purporting to show scenes of the aftermath of violence. We're seeing what purports to show injured people in homes and hospitals, victims of the shelling that people are saying they are sustaining there. We keep hearing words like \"Carnage\" and \"Bloodbath\" being used by activists there, and this on a day when Arab League observers are set to arrive. And it's making people question just how effective this Arab league observer mission can actually be. You know, a few days ago, a protocol was signed with the Syrian government between the Arab League and the Syrian government on December 20 to allow these observers in. The same day we got reports of a massacre happening where hundreds of people were killed. So right now, a big question as to what the Arab league will be able to accomplish. Will they be given free rein to the affected areas? One Arab League member telling us by phone today that they will travel to homes tomorrow. But again, a question as to whether they will actually be able to go to the neighborhoods that have been hardest hit. Ali?",

So I think that there's a good chance to recover the data if they didn't smash the hard drive but merely threw it in the water.

When you think about an island that is not very mountainous, but very heavily vegetated, a lot of defoliation going to take place, a lot of leaves, a lot of trees, a lot of branches, as we saw across the Barbuda and Antigua, they begin bonding and stay in the direction the winds have bent them, some 90 degrees so, in the direction the wind bend. So, this is going to all take place inside the next couple of hours. That becomes tremendous danger and tremendous risk as far as projectiles are concerned on a wooded and heavy forested island.

But with a category 5 moves ashore across this region, we expect the power outages to be almost widespread for the eastern half of the island. The most populous and populated corner of the island. This, in fact, could leave the vast majority of the island in the dark for weeks in some spots and, of course, the storm surge threat is extreme, 7 to 11 feet across what is normally dry ground. Across Puerto Rico, six to nine feet. We're talking about typically two feet moving your car. Say, you get up to three to four feet, getting into the first floor of your home, six to nine feet pushes up to the second floor of your home and, of course, the rainfall amounts within the mountains could be as much as 10 to almost 20 inches and Irma did not produce more than three to four inches across much of the Caribbean.

So getting any real details about what is being discussed behind closed doors is going to be very, very difficult. The only time we saw the leaders yesterday was just before they went behind closed doors for their first three-way meeting. We saw President Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, taking a walk in the woods, if you will. The three leaders looked very happy to be there, Mr. Clinton stopped and told reporters that they have agreed not to answer any questions or make any comments. Mr. Clinton, also before that walk in the woods, met separately with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, he also had a meeting with the Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak. And then last night he had separate meetings with each of those leaders once again. Then all the leaders and their negotiating teams got together for dinner. The White House describes the talks as informal and constructive, said they got off to a good start with a good atmosphere. But has also -- the White house is also saying that they are engaged in serious discussions and that they are getting to the substance of these issues. Now we do know, senior administration officials tell CNN that President Clinton is prepared to force discussion about possible compromises as the talks proceed. One of those compromises focuses on Jerusalem. Both sides are claiming ties to the holy city. The compromise would leave Jerusalem mostly in Israel's hands but would carve out the portion of East Jerusalem, dominated by Arabs, for the Palestinians.

Again, it's as clear as mud, but that is the guidance we're hearing right now. Most of the controversy here in Florida has been zeroed in on Broward County and Palm Beach County, which are Democrat strongholds. Now, inserting a county into the controversy that's a Republican stronghold, a big county in the panhandle. It was hit by Hurricane Michael, when Hurricane Michael ravaged through that area. We have learned that 158 people were allowed to vote via e-mail or fax. Now, the rules were eased after Hurricane Michael to accommodate those counties. But voting by e-mail or fax was still not allowed, so it's still unclear how those votes are going to be handled. Now, there's a slew of lawsuits. I wanted to zero in on one that could actually have an impact if it actually goes as the Dems are hoping for. A lawsuit that was filed in Tallahassee. There's a hearing tomorrow. It alleges the state law that requires that the signature match for a mail-in ballot with the signature on record is unconstitutional. Now, the reason why that could have an impact is because that would insert thousands of ballots into this very narrow race, Kate. So a lot of moving parts here in Florida.

        "statement": "Sir. Chairman Pallone, Ranking member Walden and distinguished members of the committee, thank you for inviting me here today. First like to start by thanking <ALL> of you for your support of the agency and U.S. government with the laws that you pass and become law of the land. It has helped a great deal on our response. FDA has a <CRITICAL> role in the federal government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain focused on our mission of protecting and promoting the health and safety of Americans. President Trump has requested and we have provided appropriate regulatory flexibilities to assure that the American public have access to <CRITICAL> medical products, sea foods and a confidence that the government is taking measures to address important public health issues. FDA has used emergency authority since the beginning of this pandemic. We've issued more than a 100 emergency use authorizations for diagnostics, Personal Protective Equipment, ventilators and other devices as <WELL> as for drug products. Since the public health emergency was declared, we issued more than 50 guidance documents to help, ensure the continuity of healthcare and safe food supply. And we put into place new initiatives to accelerate the development of needed products. Additionally, we have kept the American public up to date on what they <NEED TO> do to protect themselves and to contain the virus from spreading. We are now preparing for the next phase of addressing this evolving crisis. It is mission <CRITICAL> that the agency continue to be diligent, assuring the safety of the products that we regulate and that we also put in place, processes needed to assure the protections that the public will need. There are a number of experiences we have gained over the past few months that will inform our plans. We recognize that we <MUST> be bold in our decision making and advance effective solutions to achieve challenging public health objectives. Therefore we have begun a comprehensive real time review and assessment of our actions today to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective is to identify and address potential organizational and programmatic changes that <SHOULD> be implemented without delay to advance the ongoing response to COVID-19. We <NEED TO> assure that we leverage what is working <WELL> while at the same time review our framework and policies to be positioned to effectively identify and respond to quickly evolving public health situations. A major focus of this effort will be to identify what regulatory policies <SHOULD> be continued and accelerate, consistent with executive order 13294 signed by the President. Durable policy, organization and programmatic changes will be consistent with advancing the agency's public health mission and will inform our strategic priorities, moving forward. One of the challenges facing FDA during the COVID-19 pandemic is how do we assure the timely review of medical product applications, despite an incredible surge in volume and constraints on our ability to conduct insight inspections. I am pleased to announce today that FDA has maintained the same pace of meeting its goals on applications for medical products for the last six months that it has maintained in recent years. We are on target to meet our user fee goals for the drugs this year by reviewing and taking timely action on at least 90 percent of brand, generic and biosimilar drug applications, even during the pandemic. Additionally, this work has continued at a time when the number of applications received in some centers is substantially higher than the pre- COVID-19 times. I want to thank the more than 17,000 employees of the FDA for their incredible efforts, one that reflects the remarkable dedication and commitment to the public health of <ALL> Americans. Finally, I'd like to discuss what is top of mind for <ALL> Americans, namely the work that FDA is doing to facilitate the development of safe vaccines and therapeutics. FDA launched emergency review and development program called the Coronavirus Treatment Accelerated Program or CTAB and we continue to work night and day to provide guidance and to review proposals from companies, scientists and researchers who are developing therapies. Let me be <CLEAR>, the date in science will dictate when we'll have safe and effective treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 as Dr. Fauci just mentioned. Toward that end, FDA is using <EVERY> available authority and applying <EVERY> appropriate regulatory flexibility to facilitate the development and testing. We have not lost sight of our solemn responsibility to the American people to ensure our decisions related to <ALL> medical products are based on science and data and as a commitment that the American public can have confidence in. Again, I assure you that the FDA will provide leadership, expertise, guidance information and whatever else is needed as we continue to address this unprecedented challenge. Thank you and I look forward to your questions."

And here you see it again with accumulation expected to be along this area including Darwin again, an additional 15 to 25 centimeters not out of the question. There were areas here that had over 100 centimeters of -- 100 millimeters I should say -- of rainfall in the last 24 hours. Darwin had about 45 millimeters of rain. So this is what the cyclone looks like here. We're expecting it to continue kind of moving over this area over the next two to three days. So we'll watch what happens with that. The other storm, Diane, is expected to stay out at sea over the western coast of Australia far away enough not to cause any kind of severe problems. So we'll be watching what happens with that. I was hoping, Kristie, that today I could tell you that we had snow in the forecast for Beijing. This is an area that continues to be very, very dry, still in the midst of a moderate drought in the Beijing area proper. Areas farther to the south are actually in what's considered a severe drought.

This was an Arab leader who, for instance, he was opposed to the U.S. pulling out of the joint comprehensive plan of action, the Iran Nuclear Deal.

What we witnessed and what we were part of when Kevin McCarthy went into what we thought would be an anti-climactic event. We thought he would get the majority of votes within the Republican caucus to be the nominee for House speaker. Before it started, it was over because we were learning quickly standing right outside the door that Kevin McCarthy instead of giving his speech about why he wanted to be the House speaker gave a speech of why he was dropping out of the race. Lots of reasons we are told why he did that. First and foremost, it was going to be very tough to get the majority of the House, 218 votes, at the end of October. And another we are told is even if he did get that, it would just be hard to govern. Right now the question is who is going to be House speaker? Somebody has to do the job. At this point, the name of the game is Paul Ryan. Problem is he doesn't want the job. He has made that clear from the get-go. He doesn't want it. He wants to continue the current position of the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. He is a self-described policy wonk. He is looking forward to trying to reform the tax code and doing that with his current perch and then maybe leaving the House, not staying in Congress forever. He is a young man, but he is getting a lot of pressure. The current House Speaker John Boehner is trying to convince him to stay and others are trying to convince him to put his hat in ring. There is a meeting later this morning among House Republicans where they are going to try to begin to sort out their differences and trying to figure out if they can find that person to replace Kevin McCarthy to be in the running who could get the majority. All we know is that John Boehner, the current House speaker, still insists he is out of there at the end of October -- John and Michelle.",
        "statement": "Congress full of surprises. Thanks, Dana. So with McCarthy now out of the race for House speaker, who else is left? Keep in mind, anybody <<COULD>> throw their hat in the race even John Berman. Utah's Jason Chaffetz has already declared he is running and conservatives are backing little known Florida lawmaker, Daniel Webster, a fierce critic of John Boehner. Also in contention is Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia, <BEST> known for backing an amendment to a spending bill that <WOULD> have allowed confederate flags to fly at grave sites in federal cemeteries. And former House Speaker Newt Gingrich indicating he <WOULD> be interested if asked. Officially declaring, though, they are not running are Washington's Kathy McMorris Rogers and Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi."

Now the judge was citing the most compelling reason for this was the <NEED TO> find an unbiased jury and to preserve Scott Peterson's right to a fair trial. But he also issued this ruling with strong considerations for the victims and some of the witnesses in this case. He ruled it involves -- this preliminary hearing involves -- members of the public who <NEVER> asked to be involved in a high-profile case and who <WOULD> almost under <ALL> other circumstances retain significant privacy rights in having their likenesses broadcast over national television. He went on to say it involves victims' families who will be forced to relive their worst nightmare in a very public way, which he said unfortunately is necessary to the process. And then he finally said televising these passionate proceedings is not, however, necessary to that process. Last week, Laci Peterson's family, the Rocha family, did put out a written statement reminding everyone that this is not a story for the media, it is their life, and <WOULD> caused them a great deal of angst and also a great deal of harm if this continued to go out over the airwaves. There are a lot of details <ABOUT> Laci's death that they just don't want to hear themselves, as <WELL> as having it broadcast to the nation. So again, the family for Laci Peterson now <<PROBABLY>> very happy that this ruling has come down, that the judge will not allow cameras in the courtroom when Scott Peterson goes before that preliminary hearing.

You already have lower voting totals and it's our folks that stay at home. Meanwhile, a new Gallup poll shows Republicans have a 10-point lead in voter enthusiasm going into the midterms.

He's been vilifying him over Twitter and in actual press conferences for quite some time. But he was very cautious not to fire Mueller because there would be obvious political consequences, particularly during the midterm elections. So now he can say, I didn't fire Mueller. I didn't touch Mueller. I also didn't touch Rod Rosenstein. I have no issue with him following the New York Times revelation that maybe the 25th amendment being talked about or him wearing a wire. I'm just going to replace the person who made it possible that Rod Rosenstein would have his position and Mueller would have oversight by that person. And so, by putting Matthew Whitaker in the position, which by the way is not in line of succession. It would naturally go to the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, then to a solicitor general. The chief of staff or the A.G. is not the person who is supposed to be in line. And so, one has to first wonder by what authority he's going to put him there. But the president already told us he's temporary. He'll have a more permanent placement put there in the long run. So, I'm wondering if in many ways this is the president's attempt to gain information about the investigation. So, once he's downloaded everything and debriefed from Robert Mueller and then he walks away to have a permanent replacement who is Senate- confirmed come in, well, guess what Donald Trump has? He's got the keys to the castle.",

But the thing that -- two things those of us in the Navy admire most about him aside from his grit and courage in the cockpit was the way he handled himself as a POW, and it's legendary. Everybody knows the story about how he refused to get released, even when the Vietnamese found out his father was a four- star admiral. But the other thing that so many of us respect about him is his humility. We talk about his sense of humor. He can be cantankerous and certainly tough on people. But he was very humble. He never bragged about himself and what he did. It was always the team and what we were doing as a team or a caucus or as a military.

But he talks about the new approach, and as you watched the news conference, that sort of collides a bit with the fact right now we're seeing the old approach. And while he went onto say that that was just a visible part, they have been quite assertive about seeing to it that we get the information; that there's this deployment, there's that deployment. The Army secretary, in fact, comes out and says deployment orders are going out for Army units. They are visibly telling the world, we are going to build up in a rather large scale, a massive scale, in a certain region of the world. So the questions is, is that just something to impress the other countries, or is that something that precedes combat? The question was asked, of course; he didn't give an answer.

But here is an interesting twist. Less than half of those polled actually favor the war in Afghanistan. 51 percent now oppose it. And stay with us. We're going to have live coverage of President Obama's announcement from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. It is scheduled for 11:45 Eastern. Of course, 8:45 Pacific. A top executive at the investment firm headed by Texas financier Allen Stanford in handcuffs this morning as she appearance before a federal magistrate in Houston. Laura Pendergest-Holt, chief investment officer at Stanford Financial Group, was arrested and charged yesterday. She's accused of obstructing a federal brought into an alleged $8 billion investment scheme at the company. We'll keep our eye on that story for you today. Your money. Citigroup's future. The U.S. government will soon have more control over the troubled banking giant. The Feds will convert $25 billion worth of preferred stock, we all now own, to common shares. That means the government could end up with 30 to 40 percent of Citigroup's common stock. It is worth noting this third bailout effort will give Citigroup more money to operate without costing any additional taxpayer money. Here's something rare for U.S. autoworkers. A bit of good news. A couple of hours ago, Ford announced it will reopen its Cleveland engine plant number one. The reason? It becomes the first site to build Ford's new fuel-efficient eco-boost engine. Well, the plan has been idle since 2007. Ford pumped $55 million to upgrade and bring back 250 workers. General Motors is eyeing a big change. They're now looking at ways to restructure European operations after losses quadrupled there last quarter. That leading to protests at some of their overseas plants.

And one <THING> that the German government has been saying in the past is that, in order to get that government bailout, Opel will <<PROBABLY>> <HAVE TO> cut a substantial amount of its ties with General Motors as a prerequisite because the German government says if it is going to give German taxpayer money to Opel and it doesn't want that money ending up in Detroit, it wants that money to save jobs here in Germany.

And that would have generated a lot of sparks, and parts of the plane may have fallen off. We have already see from some of the video that the right engine has become disengaged from the aircraft. So that would have been the immediate cause of the fire. And then of course as the other parts of the plane broke off, the fire -- you get that explosion, which blows part of the wing away. Now, as to the reason that the plane came down and then crashed in the first place, we don't know. As John alluded to, the first question is whether or not the plane came down, skidded to have runway, the nose or the main gear collapsed. And that was the incident. Or, as is widely being reported in aviation circles, was the landing gear not down? Was the plane attempting to do a go around or an aborted landing? There is rumors that air traffic control had authorized the plane to climb again to 4,000 feet, but the plane was unable to gain power sufficiently fast enough. Now that would be born out, for example, Lynda, by those very hot conditions that you talk about. It does take those turbo fan engines longer to spool up to takeoff power in 50 degrees heat. It is a simple fact of physics. We just don't know at the moment. I would expect very rapidly, very clearly that we will get an indication what happened here. Was it a case of gear collapsing on landing or some other technical issue or did the plane attempt to abort its landing and then fell foul.",

And what the president is trying to do is back up some of the rhetoric we're going to see today at this summit with some money, even in these lean budget times, trying to make it a priority. In his new budget, he has about $132 million that would be given out in grants across the country to individual schools to combat bullying. But of course, we've got to note, that budget right now is caught up into some big negotiations with House Republicans, Senate Democrats. It's unclear whether the president's budget is going to move forward at all and, so, this could be one of many priorities that get caught up in some of this fighting here in Washington. I think the second big thing to watch is that a new bipartisan bill was introduced this week. Democratic senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Mark Kirk, a Republican of Illinois, that would basically put out specific guidelines for schools who get federal funds, they would have to adopt a code of conduct that prevented harassment, bullying, violence, et cetera, and also would require states, for the first time, to actually keep some statistics on bullying and provide that to the federal government so they can get their arms around how big this problem really is. The president and first lady have taken a personal interest. They've taped this public service announcement, there, that's been on Facebook, other social media. And so, I think the bottom line is, the point of this summit for the White House today is to try to bring some much-need attention to the issue today. But the key is going to be, as you pointed out, what happens tomorrow and the day after? Does Congress, does this White House actually follow-up with some money in the budget that helps prevent bullying? Kate?",
        "statement": "But when you consider how many different interests are trying to get on the president's agenda <ALL> at once, it does mean that the president is serious, that he is choosing this bullying summit, if you will, to shine the spotlight that he has on it."

Now, rightly or wrongly, fairly or unfairly, I think that Governor Bush strikes a lot of people, including a lot of people who were inclined to like him as in that mode, who are saying, well, why is he here. Also, when he speaks, whether it's true or not, it appears to be can same-old, same-old, sort of plain vanilla kind of talk and he doesn't crack through.

Some of the various civil rights activists being honored at this museum. He talked about James Meredith, the first black student to enter the University of Mississippi back in 1962. And he spent a good deal of time talking about Medgar Evers, whose widow was on the tour with him and spoke at the event, the larger event in the plaza behind me. But as you mentioned, those two congressmen, John Lewis and Bennie Thompson, along with the NAACP, several other prominent civil rights activists, and Mississippi politicians, decided not to attend in protest at Trump being invited. It was Mississippi governor, Phil Bryant, who extended the invitation. Some Mississippi Democrats wanted him to rescind it. That did not happen. Key and central in the criticism of the president is his record on civil rights or his record as a protector and defender of civil rights. A lot of his critics believe he doesn't have such a record. Instead, he has a record of racial insensitivity. Some mentioned the fact he questioned the legitimacy of America's first black president. He was one of the most prominent Birthers in the Birtherism movement. He also has endorsed an Alabama Senate candidate, Roy Moore, who when asked when America was last great, talked about the era of slavery. He said families were united, even though we had slavery. There's a long list of criticism from these folks who do not want to see the president participate here. John Lewis and Bennie Thompson mentioned the fact he's been slamming mostly black NFL athletes kneeling to protest racial inequality. Others have mentioned the Voter Integrity Commission the president has set up.

But that's not the case when it comes to an organization that is this experienced and highly capable of morphing and readapting itself. We spoke to two mid-ranking ISIS members who handed themselves over to the Syrian Democratic forces who had some interesting insight as to what it is that ISIS may be planning next.",
        "statement": "ISIS's survival is not tied to the fate of its crumbling caliphate, it planned for this day. \"ISIS did calculate that one day they will be finished,\" the Bahraini man says, his voice calm and steady. His name is Omar, he says he was in charge of ideological training at ISIS military camps in Deir ez- Zor and Raqqa. He tells us, \"They did not put a lot of money into the battles they fought. The weapons they used were the weapons of the enemy, the money went elsewhere,\" Omar says. Even during times of austerity, there was <ALWAYS> a calculation for the future. No one knows exactly how much ISIS is worth now. In 2014, the group was thought to have a total of $1.5 to $2 billion. It was making a million dollars a day from oil fields, more than enough for its regular expenses. ISIS has distributed its revenues overseas for the next phase of its war. Isoma is an ISIS member from Morocco, who oversaw the border crossings between Turkey and ISIS territory. He tells us, that ISIS <WOULD> train and dispatch members to set up companies, which then acted as facilitators but also behaved as regular businesses. ISIS <MAY> no longer physically control swaths of Syria and Iraq, but it thrives underground and it is widely assumed that the ISIS leadership, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and his top lieutenants are in the border areas between Syria and Iraq, familiar territory. The first stage of the ISIS insurgency back in 2010 was called aggressive hibernation, making money, building networks in the deserts and cities of Iraq. In many ways, ISIS is going back to that strategy, waiting for the next opportunity. It's an ideology that exploits and feeds off of deep- seated grievances, fosters a thirst for revenge. \"They will spring up somewhere else,\" Omar says, \"if you don't <KNOW> how to fight them ideologically.\" ISIS plots for the long game. Its leaders are fond of saying that it's not ruling Mosul and Raqqa that counts. It's the will to fight, and ISIS will once again simply bide its time. Arwa Damon, CNN, Northern Syria."

Now U.S. President Barack Obama is giving diplomacy another chance, but says a military strike could still be in the cards. Now he has asked congress to postpone a vote on the use of force in Syria. The U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov will meet in Geneva on Thursday. Four men will be sentenced on Friday for raping and killing an Indian woman in New Delhi last year. And the men could face the death penalty. Now the brutal attack has sparked nationwide protests demanding protection for women against sexual violence. A powerful explosion has damaged a foreign ministry building in the Libyan city of Benghazi. It also slightly injured a security guard at the central bank of Libya. Now the explosion happened at 7:00 am local time. And a witness told CNN that the street would have been full of people one hour later. Now this comes exactly one year after the attack on the U.S. consulate which killed four Americans. Now the date is a significant one for Americans: 9/11. 12 years ago, the Twin Towers fell in New York, leaving a void in the city and the nation. And here you can see a nighttime tribute, the columns of light shine where the World Trade Center once stood. Now the terror attacks killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania. It is a day that made Americans feel scared and vulnerable, a day they vowed to never forget. Now 9/11 was orchestrated by al Qaeda. And it touched off the so- called war on terror. And let's bring in Peter Bergen now from Washington. He is our CNN security analyst and recently co-authored a report on the threat of terrorism today. And Peter, welcome to the program. 12 years after 9/11 what is your assessment? What kind of threat does al Qaeda pose today?",

And even the affiliate groups of al Qaeda are not in great shape, whether that's in Yemen or as we saw in Mali with the French army going in earlier this year and rolling back an al Qaeda affiliate that had taken over half the country. You <KNOW>, that said, we're also the anniversary of the Benghazi attack, as you just pointed out. Groups with -- inspired by al Qaeda in Libya are doing <<SOMEWHAT>> OK and we are seeing the most effective fighting force in Syria is an al Qaeda affiliate, and that is a cause for real concern."

Kim was elected to parliament in the early 1960s, just days before a military coup by then Gen. Pak Chung Hee. Kim's fiery and provocative calls for democracy almost got him killed several times. In 1973, South Korean secret agents tried to dump him into the sea. He was also <GIVEN> the death sentence by military dictator Chun Doo Hwan, and <ONLY> managed to survive with the intervention of the United States. He also carries a limp from a suspected assassination attempt. In 1980, Kim was living in exile in the United States when his home town of Kwangju erupted in a pro-democracy uprising. Kim made an emotional plea for international intervention while hundreds of his countrymen were killed by South Korean paratroopers. Upon his return in 1985, Kim supported a nationwide pro-democracy movement that toppled the military government. With his presidential election in 1998, he became the first opposition leader to reach the office. Kim has maintained a liberal stance toward the North throughout his political career, even as he was branded a Communist sympathizer. The Communist card used against him time and again to turn conservative votes against him. This liberal position developed into the sunshine policy, or active engagement with the North, a policy some credit with achieving the recent mood of reconciliation on the Korean peninsula. But Kim's toughest battle <<COULD>> still lie ahead. While symbolic gestures abound, there has yet been any concrete moves to <REDUCE> the military tension on the world's most heavily fortified border.

That 5 percent hike adds up to a tax increase of more than $17 billion on taxpayers, which is why you already hear complaints from the president's fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill this morning. And there's another big worry, the timeline to find a fix is really short. He says it would kick in June 10th. That's less than two weeks to begin solving a problem that this president, his predecessors, Congress and Mexico have not been able or willing to solve for decades.

In his first in-depth interview since the raid, Cohen wouldn't answer when asked if the president directed him to make that payment or promise to reimburse him. In the past, he said he made the payment on his own initiative. This time he said, \"I want to answer. One day I will answer, but for now I can't comment further on advice of my counsel.\" That counsel, Cohen's new attorney Guy Petrillo, former chief of the criminal division at the Southern District. Cohen hasn't been charged with any crime but in recent weeks, sources say he has been <FEELING> angry and isolated by the president's treatment of him. And friends have encouraged him to speak to the press to help him win over the court of public <<OPINION>>. He told ABC, \"I will not be a punching bag as part of anyone's defense strategy. I am not a villain of this story, and I will not allow others to try to depict me that way.\" Trump's now former personal lawyer also sought to separate himself from the president, who has slammed the FBI and repeatedly called the Mueller probe a witch hunt. Cohen instead praising the FBI as courteous and professional when conducting the April raids: \"I don't agree with those who demonize or vilify the FBI. I respect the FBI as an institution, as <WELL> as their agents.\" And saying he doesn't agree with Trump on the Russia investigation: \"I don't like the term 'witch hunt.' As an American, I repudiate Russia's or any other foreign government's attempt to interfere or meddle in our democratic process. And I <WOULD> call on <ALL> Americans to do the same.\" Cohen also called the decision by Trump campaign officials to meet with Russians in June 2016 a mistake. But <WOULD> not say whether Trump knew <ABOUT> the meeting before it happened, citing his lawyer's advice."

They're examining whether non-profit tax laws were followed. CNN reported back in November of 2016 that the FBI had opened preliminary inquiries into whether there had been any sort of impropriety with the foundation's dealings and money and that caused some tensions within the bureau and the Justice Department. And so, the current inquiry, at least in part, as a continuation of that probe, that originated before the presidential election, but what's unclear is precisely what new evidence, if any, ignited the current federal investigation after those initial inquiries were stalled. Now the Clinton camp is pushing back very hard against this news as Nick Merrill, a spokesman, for Clinton told me. Let's call this what it is, a sham, and a spokesperson for the Clinton Foundation said the Clinton Foundation has been subjected to politically motivated allegations and time after time those allegations have been proven false.

It's a time for <ALL> of us to reach out our collective arms and put them <AROUND> <ALL> of the students, the families, and the faculty at Santana High School. They need us. They <NEED TO> <KNOW> we're there. We <NEED TO> <KNOW> we care, and <ALL> the support that they need is there for them. I want to once, again, <TAKE> the opportunity to applaud the San Diego County Sheriff's Department for their very prompt response. As it was already stated, this <<COULD>> have been a lot worse. The deputies were there in a moment's notice, and what <<COULD>> have been chaos was calmness, orderliness, and what I've observed from the entire law enforcement team -- the paramedic, <ALL> of those who responded -- was of the highest professional that you will ever see anywhere at any time. And I thank you for that. As I was doing a lot of thinking, and as I've talked and seen a lot of people, I had questions asked to me what did the county of San Diego do after Columbine? What did we do? Did you do anything? Yes, we did. We've been doing <QUITE> <A BIT> in the county of San Diego, and I'm proud to say that, after Columbine, we had anti-violence training for thousands of students, working with the Grossmont Union High School District. And over the past several years, the board of supervisors has put virtually millions and millions of dollars into after-school programs. We've worked with the presiding judge of the juvenile court, our probation officer, with programs, frankly, that have received national recognition. The sheriff's has been a part of that too, and the district attorney -- trying particularly to turn the lives <AROUND> of those children that we have classified as at-risk students. But it wasn't enough. It wasn't enough to prevent this tragedy. And I, frankly, don't <KNOW> if anything <<COULD>> have prevented it. I have heard that there were those who were told that this young man was going to do this. I <<GUESS>> the <QUESTION> to <ALL> of us: Had one of those individuals told the authorities <WOULD> it have made a difference? None of us will ever <KNOW>. We'll <NEVER> <KNOW>. But <ALL> of the programs, <ALL> of the anti-violence training -- the one most <CRUCIAL> violence prevention is a strong family, a strong family. We can have <ALL> the programs in the world, <ALL> the support from <ALL> the government agencies, which we've tried to do in this county, but there's nothing that takes the place of a strong family, which is the most <CRUCIAL> violence prevention that we have in our community. And it's a time now not <ONLY> to reach out to those who are most in need, but also to reach out in particular to the students, and to the parents in our community. We have more troubled youngsters out there. We have more parents out there that need help. It's up to <ALL> of us to put our heads together over the next weeks and months and see can we do better? Are there some other things that we can do to make it more inviting for those students to step forward and say, I need help, I've got a problem, or for a parent to step forward and say, I need help -- I'm not as good a parent as I <<COULD>> be, and I need help. Because you <KNOW> what? There are the resources out there to help. <ALL> they <HAVE TO> do is ask. And we <NEED TO> make <<<SURE>>> in this community that they ask and they <<FEEL>> like it's easy to ask that <QUESTION>, to help. We <MUST> <ALL> of us -- we <ALL> share the responsibility for what happened here. We <MUST> listen to our kids. We <MUST> listen deeper to our kids and pay more attention, and when our kids tell us things, to act upon them. And as parents and <ALL> of us as adults in the community, spend time with our kids. We can have <ALL> the programs -- and we <KNOW> we can -- we have them in this county, to help -- but it's not the programs that are going to make the difference. It's one individual taking the interest in the life of a child that is ultimately going to make that difference. So I put a call out today: <TAKE> the hand of a child and show them the way. It <MAY> be a child who is troubled, that needs that hand more than another, but I can tell you <ALL> children need us as adults. This is a great community. East county is a special place. And we've seen people come together in the city of Santee for Santana High School students like I've seen at no other time. It's the greatness of these students: By and large, the students at Santana High School -- they're responsible, they're bright, and they're good students. We'll get through this, and we will be stronger. We will be stronger. But right now let's reach out to those kids and make a special effort to do that. And I thank you very much."

And he says the best way to increase supply is to, first of all, do more offshore drilling here at home, start drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, open up some public lands out in the West for oil shale development. Now, the president also wants to streamline regulations so that we can build more oil refineries in the United States. He points out we haven't built one since the early '70s. But then Democrats come back at him and say, look, those are old ideas. You can't drill your way out of this situation. Democrats are more in favor -- as you pointed out, Kyra, they're looking at regulation, cracking down on speculation in the oil futures market. Democrats believe that that may be responsible for up to 25 percent of the hike that we've seen in fuel prices. They also want to do things like invest more money in alternative energy sources: wind, solar, ethanol, things like that. And then, also, let some oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Right now, there are bills, energy bills in the Senate, in the House, but their log-jammed, they're stalemated, not going anywhere.

Now, this is Biden's second TV ad that's running in Iowa, focusing, homing in there on health care. His first TV ad really focused on the issue of electability. And it also highlighted some polls where Biden was leading President Trump in head-to-head matchups. But we're now seeing this new poll released yesterday from Monmouth University that showed that there's no clear leader right now in the Democratic 2020 race. You had Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both at 20 percent and then Joe Biden at 19 percent. But this poll could be an outlier. If you take a look at the polling that was released last week by CNN, Biden was maintaining the lead there, 29 percent, followed by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren at 15 and 14 percent.

There were those hit first where the water came up and has since receded, leaving behind homes devastated by water and mud, with people going back to realize they've lost everything. And there are places like here in Rockhampton where the water has come up and you can see it's not going anywhere quickly. It's expected to <TAKE> a week or more to recede, which means throughout that time, people are going to be living amongst this, wading through waist-deep water, getting <AROUND> in boats. The water has become stagnant, it's <A BIT> smelly. Mosquitoes and other insects are a really big problem. And it's difficult getting access to food and water. It's hard living here in the moment. And there are still areas in the state of Queensland where the water is still rising, where it's still raining heavily and people are desperately building flood defense to try and protect their homes and towns. Those flood levels are not expected to peak for a few days yet. So, then the clean up begins and it's going to be huge -- months, years, people's homes and towns. But also, more importantly, in this very big state, the transport infrastructure -- roads and railways have really been seriously damaged by this. And the government here in Queensland and in the federal government of Australia say that's a real problem, it's expensive and that's going to <TAKE> a long time to fix. Back to you, Randi."

And the Kurds know this. And the SDF has taken steps to try and reassure the population that, once they kick ISIS out, they're going to come up with some sort of a local governing council to do that. I don't think the SDF has real territorial demands on Raqqa as such. But they do want some sort of an autonomous Kurdish region.

        "previous_statement": "-- is China's core interest. And the One China principle is the cornerstone of the bilateral relationship between Beijing and Washington. They like to say that every U.S. president since Jimmy Carter has committed to this policy and stuck to it. And they certainly hope the Trump White House would do the same instead of derailing four decades of development and achievements. But Mr. Trump does have a point about the U.S. does sell billions of dollars of arms to Taiwan to allow it to defend itself against a potential Chinese attack. But it's exactly this kind of strategic ambiguity in the One China policy that's allowed Beijing, Washington, as well as Taipei to maintain relative peace and stability in the decades past. So at least on this very sensitive issue what's being said matters as much as what's being done. Now other issues Chinese officials have been quite restrained and measured in their response to Mr. Trump's remarks, including issues like trade, the South China Sea and the cyber security What they have been saying here is this relationship has so much going for it if more cooperation, less confrontation is the attitude both sides adopt The also like to point out to the phone conversation Mr. Trump had with Chinese president Xi Jinping after Trump's election that both leader have said mutual respect is very important in dealing with each other. One other thing they like to bring up is that Mr. Trump is not president yet. So what he has been saying so far is not official U.S. policy. And the Chinese government pays more attention to official policies instead of a leader's style and personalities. But privately, many official have expressed to me that they're unsure about how to deal with this new U.S. president, who likes to conduct foreign policy online. Some have even asked of me for suggestions. My response, \"Follow him on Twitter. Read his tweets and have an answer ready for reporters like us.\" -- Steven Jiang, CNN, Beijing.",

Were they devaluing because they were facing a massive, massive fall- off in economic activity? I think what this number shows us today, yes, it's weak, it's down to the 70 or lower so but it shows an economy that it is not about to fall off a cliff. There is no, quote, \"hard landing\" that is happening in the Chinese economy. So that really is a sigh of relief. It shows, and particularly if you drill down in the numbers a little bit deeper, it shows that in March particularly there was a little bit of a pick-up in activity. So it's all sort of pointing towards the right sort of direction. The reason this is happening, though, is because the Chinese government has been stimulating the economy. Remember, it's cut interest rates some six times since late 2014. It's cut the amount of reserves the banks have to keep at the central bank. So basically it's funneling a large amount of money out into the system for people to borrow. So it's encouraging borrowing, encouraging spending and that is why we're seeing this number. Bang in line, as I say, with expectations. Remember, the government said between 6.5 percent and 7 percent growth this year is the target. Guess what, we're at 6.7.",

        "statement": "Exactly. We're going to talk <ABOUT> what's in the pipeline, what's coming up and what are some new things that women can get even now. Let's start off with prevention. There are some interesting advances in prevention. First of <ALL> genetic testing keeps getting better and better. And many doctors encourage this if you have a family history of breast cancer to find out if you <MIGHT> carry a gene that <WOULD> lead you to get breast cancer and then you can make better decisions. Tamoxifen and relozafine are two drugs that some women who don't have breast cancer but have a family history of it decide to <TAKE> as prevention. Also, some women get mastectomies, they actually have their breasts removed even if they're <TOTALLY> healthy so that they won't get breast cancer in the future, again if they have a family history. Women also get their ovaries removed for the same reason. That decreases the amount of estrogen in the body so that they won't get breast cancer. And let's look at detection. Digital mammography. This is something that is new, that is up and coming, that some doctors <<<BELIEVE>>> gives a much better <VIEW> of the breast. And for many breast cancer practices MRIs are becoming standard. There have been many studies that show they are much better than mammograms at detecting cancer. Now let's <TAKE> a look at treatment. Just yesterday there was a big study on a drug called FEMARA. And what this drug seems to do is it cuts in half the chance that a woman with breast cancer will get breast cancer again. Also denser doses of chemotherapy. In other words chemotherapy where the doses are <GIVEN> more closely together has shown some promise. Also radiation sooner after surgery. In other words, starting sooner than usual. And also something called seed radiation, which is where little seeds are put near the actual cancer <RATHER> than radiating the entire breast. Now, it's still important to say that with <ALL> of these advances, with <ALL> of these great things that are coming out, that the three big ways to prevent cancer from starting in the first place, mammography, examining your own breasts and having a doctor examine your breasts -- there's no substitute for that."

But I found a critic <ABOUT> these jobs numbers, Carol. A trader I talked to just a short time ago. He's skeptical <ABOUT> these numbers. He says, look, you <KNOW>, you look at the economy as a whole. The economy actually has been producing weak manufacturing reports over the past month and a half. He said also that number, 165,000 jobs added last month, it's good he says, but it's half of what we really <NEED TO> continue growth in the jobs market. And <ABOUT> that wealth effect that your -- that your guest was just talking <ABOUT>. He said -- the trader I talked to said there's a huge disconnect at this point. The bulk of the country, the bulk of Americans are not invested in the stock market. Their biggest asset is their home, and their home prices are still depressed or they're underwater. Meaning they owe more than their house is worth. So this one trader is <A LITTLE> skeptical <ABOUT> these jobs numbers as far as recovery, a strong recovery going on, but the triple-digit gains in those numbers I <HAVE TO> say, they are a good sign -- Carol."

Health officials say the high temperatures have led to five deaths in one county alone. And now they're investigating at least 57 others may have been caused by the heat there.

But, at the same time, you have -- the reason you have senators like Susan Collins trying to pull back from this idea of pushing a nomination through before the November election is because I think she's trying to avoid riling up her opposition. The problem for many Republicans, however, is that, for the Republican base, this is such a motivating issue. It's a core issue for them.

So this is a big night for Bernie Sanders. As Jeff Weaver, his campaign manager just noted, we don't know the final numbers yet. It's likely one will win one or two more delegates than that. So 90 precincts are still out. Wolf, where are they? They're all spread around the state, but the bulk of them here, we still only have 88-percent of the vote in the largest county in Iowa, Polk County, so that's a big thing. Now Secretary Clinton has been winning by this margin about all night long. There's no guarantee when the others come in they'll be consistent, but she has had that roughly 7-point margin throughout the night. So they would assume that although there could be some Sanders' precincts; we still don't know. Where else are they? Over here in Linn County you see 95-percent of the vote, that means there's still a few precincts out. Bernie Sanders winning quite handily out here in the Cedar Rapids area and the suburbs around it. We're waiting for some more votes there. Up here in Dubuque, in Dubuque County, 97-percent; that's gone up in the last couple of minutes. So they're getting close to finishing up here. Secretary Clinton with a lead up there. Senator Sanders though running pretty competitive. Down here in Scott County, in Davenport, now up to 98-percent. That's gone up in the last couple of minutes too, where Senator Sanders is leading narrowly there. So you can find a few more if you go through some of these rural counties up here. That one's at a 100. This one is at 100. So it's getting pretty full if you go through those. So the bulk of them are down here in Polk County, in Des Moines, scattered a little bit in the east. Again, you've got 90 precincts out. We've got 95, so that means 95- percent of the vote counted. You're unlikely to shift the votes in any dramatic way. One of them will win by a little, tiny bit; we just can't tell you at the moment, because the bulk is here, because she's been leading here all night and if you're in Vegas you'd place it in her winning by this much, but I don't know if that's a safe bet the way the night's going.",

Because those systems were turned off, because the plane made that very deliberate left hand turn in between the air traffic control of Malaysia and Vietnam, so nobody really noticed right away that it made that left-hand turn towards the Indian Ocean. And the passengers, by all accounts, perhaps remained in their seats for some time. They would have realized they weren't headed north to China which was their destination. Why did they remain seated? Did something happen in the cockpit? Did the pilots maybe come on the intercom system and give some reassuring message? So it's these clues that they're putting together as they begin to rule certain things out. It's sort of what they're left with on the table right now.

In fact, the Republican frontrunner has widen his national lead according to a new Fox News poll. Take a look. The real estate mobile, up four points from last month, topping Ted Cruz, 45 to 27 percent. And just days from New York's GOP primary, Trump appears poised for a landslide victory in the empire state. A Quinnipiac poll showing him with a massive 35 point lead. The New York post says Trump reflects the best of New York values. The newspaper endorsing Trump but also saying that the Republican nominee. Trump will need to soften his tone and be more presidential. But so far Trump is not toning down his attack on what he calls a rigged political system. In fact, he writes about it in today's \"Wall Street Journal\" \"Let me ask America a question. How has the system been work out for you and your family? I, for one, is not interested in defending a system that for decades has served the interest of political parties at the expense of the people. Meanwhile, Trump's campaign manager is speaking out to CNN about a recent controversy involving a reporter. Reporter say attorney announcing this week the battery charges would not filed against Corey Lewandowski who's accused of grabbing reporting Michelle Fields by the arm following a press conference. We asked Lewandowski for the reaction to the news he wouldn't be prosecuted.",

And, essentially, the charges are that this -- the State Department analyst, whose name is Kendall Myers, he's 72 years old, top-secret security clearance, and his wife, who worked in a bank -- her name is Gwendolyn -- for 30 years served as illegal agents, as they call it, for Cuba, passing information on. The government says it still doesn't know the full extent of what they passed to Cuba. There will be a damage assessment. And they don't know -- there's no real indications that they were paid directly by the Cubans for what they did. In fact, one senior law enforcement source says that they were probably true believers. Now, they did get one thing, however. And that in this indictment says that they were given a meeting in 1995, a secret meeting, with Fidel Castro. And here's how it's described in the indictment: \"While staying in a small house in Cuba, Kendall Myers and Gwendolyn Myers were visited by Fidel Castro. Fidel Castro spent the evening with Kendall Myers and Gwendolyn Myers and talked with them through an interpreter.\" Later in -- also in this indictment, Wolf, they say that in a diary entry back in 1987, Kendall Myers described Fidel Castro as a brilliant and charismatic leader. All of this came together just this week and they were arrested only yesterday.",
        "statement": "What a shocking story, indeed. <ALL> right, we will stay on top of this one. Jill Dougherty is over at the State Department. In financial news, Wall Street ended its week mixed. Stocks bobbed up and down today, with the Dow Jones industrials adding 38 points with just 20 minutes left in the session. The S&P; and Nasdaq changed little. <ALL> three indices have gained in five of the last six sessions. Investors welcomed a report suggesting job losses dramatically slowing down. In <MAY>, the government reports 345,000 lost jobs. That's <ABOUT> 175,000 fewer jobs lost than forecast, and almost 400,000 jobs less than we saw lost in January.

Happily the storm has brought out the <BEST> in people. Setting aside <ALL> political squabbles, but of course there are <ALWAYS> a few bad apples who have sought to exploit the situation with fraud and price gouging. I'll talk both sides with the Texas Attorney General and after tens of billions of dollars in damage and at least 50 deaths, will Hurricane Harvey cause Houston to turn away from its laissez-faire zoning or <<PERHAPS>> be a turning point in the national debate over climate <CHANGE>? And the President visits Texas again today. How <BEST> does a Commander-in-chief play a Consoler-In-Chief? I'll ask President George W. Bush's head of advance who dealt with Hurricane Katrina. But first, <<ARGUABLY>> the <BEST> movie of summer, Director Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk foreshadowed the events of last week in Texas, a situation that <WOULD> have been far worse were it not for the human spirit. In <MAY> of 1940, it was the English citizenry who rallied to the rescue of more than 300,000 troops who were trapped on a beach in Northern France in the early days of World War II. Those soldiers <<COULD>> almost see home across the English Channel but the shallow waters prevented rescued of warships. But instead it was 700 civilian crafts, the little ships of Dunkirk that made their way from Ram's Gate in England to assist in the rescue and so it was in Texas this week. In Houston, on Wednesday, Civilian volunteers captained bass boats, jet skis, and aluminum dingies that comprised an impromptu flotilla ferried hundreds of residents to safety. A man named Jeremy Sparkman, a health care worker, told Reuters, \"I <USUALLY> just use this boat for drinking beer. But we come together when we <NEED TO>. That is what Texans do.\" Indeed, after the Harris County Department of Homeland Security asked for volunteers last Sunday, hundreds of boat owners called and supplied quickly outstripped demand, the resulting flotilla was an American Dunkirk, minus the aerial bombardment. Nearly 50 have died and so many are still in harm's way and I don't seek to <MINIMIZE> the emotional nor physical damage that will <TAKE> untold billions and years to repair. But just for a moment can we celebrate the human spirit that we've <ALL> watched play out over the span of the last seven days? The first responders, those who risked their lives for strangers, neighbors who opened their homes to those who required shelter from the storm. Heroics to save the lives of pets. The many who undertook fundraising tasks and the many more who are responding to those calls. Or how <ABOUT> these people, who formed a human chain to save an elderly man trapped in his car on the interstate. Here is the <THING> <ABOUT> that rescue and many more like it. Nobody asked him, how he was registered to vote, nobody wanted to see his immigration papers for that matter. If there is one <THING> missing or at diminished this past week, it is partisan rancor. Not even a trumped up debate between the Democratic Houston Mayor and the Republican Governor of Texas over evacuation took hold, instead politics this week was secondary to saving lives and protecting property. The wind and the waters of Hurricane Harvey, they didn't discriminate. They lashed Republicans and Democrats and Independents, the young and the old and the rich and the poor, the black, the white, the Asian and the Hispanic. Here's hoping it's legacy is a reminder of <ALL> that <ALL> that unites us. Of course while we <ALL> wish the storm brought <ONLY> such stories of heroics and humanity, unfortunately when catastrophe strikes, it also brings out bad actors. Like the convenience store in Houston that CNN found charging $20 for a gallon of gas, $8.50 for a bottle of water and $99 for a case of water. As of Friday afternoon, Reuters reporting almost it 2,000 complaints of price gouging and fraud. Joining me now, the person in charge of pursuing such behavior, the Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Attorney General Paxton, where does free market economy end and price gouging begin? How do you <KNOW> it when you see it?"

That effort we saw on an overnight effort over the weekend, 422 Syrian civilians, including White Helmets evacuated through Israel, through Jordan. Now we have just learned from one member of the White Helmets that is 300 of their members <<COULD>> not make the evacuation point, because of Syrian roadblocks and because of fighting between Syrian-regime forces and an ISIS affiliate in southern Syria. So, they are calling for the international community to continue that effort and get them out as <WELL> as Syrian forces close in. That happened in northern Israel over the weekend. Very different story in southern Israel. Where there is a very sharp escalation between Hamas and Israel in fighting on Friday. It <ALL> started Friday morning when Israel said Hamas gunman killed an Israeli soldier operating near the border. That is the first Israeli soldier killed in the Gaza border since the end of the 2014 war. That led to a, what Israel turned a wide-scale attack against dozens of Hamas military target in Gaza. That led to four Palestinians killed. Three of which from the Hamas's military wing. A cease-fire has been in place and now it seems to be holding."

I think that we might be getting a little too caught up in, you know, what's referred to often as violations of the Logan Act.

I don't think Mueller cut the kind of deal, which is very good as Asha indicated for Flynn, just to get, you know, more coup on how it was that the Kislyak meetings went down. I think it has to do with the -- with whether or not the Trump team did indeed collude, cooperate or contact the Russian government during the lead up to the election in an attempt to win it and with Russian assistance. The other stuff, certainly, is important. Obstruction of justice, of course, is no light thing, but we know for a fact that the Russians tried to attack our democratic institutions.

A double whammy for folks in the Midwest after the worst flooding in nearly 100 years for some towns in Ohio. Forecasters say that a sweltering heat wave and more rain is expected in several states. Right now there are flood warnings and watches in nine states from Texas all the way to Ohio. At least 22 people are dead and thousands more on waking up in shelters this morning, not knowing whether or not they have a home to go back to. Entire neighborhoods are under water still at this hour. Canoes and high-riding shuttle buses are now going house to house looking for anyone who may be trapped. States of emergency have been declared, as well, in nine counties in Ohio. In Wisconsin, the governor estimating $38 million in damages so far. Streets and parking lots looking like lakes and rivers. Hundreds of aches of farmland under water as well. In fact, one of Wisconsin's biggest organic farmers says the damage could push him out of business, effecting the price of organic products across the country. And much the same in central Iowa, dealing with widespread flooding after thunderstorms dumped more rain in the already waterlogged region. Hundreds were forced out of a care center after water poured into the basement, threatening the electrical system. Emergency crews are scrambling to repair levees, as well. Well, not far from Minneapolis, the ground has been washed away, creating a precarious situation for thousands there that are now performed on a new cliff. Just look at the video. These were people who had many, many feet between themselves and a babbling brook. Now they're literally teetering on the edge. Dozens of homes have already been pushed over by the mudslide.

Today two senators will offer amendments to add a public option and there is really no middle ground in the debate over the public option. People are either for it or they're against it. Let's hear the arguments now from both sides. Richard Kirsch is in favor of the public option. He's a national campaign manager for Health Care for America Now and against the option is the Michael Cannon. He is the director of health policy studies for the Cato Institute. Richard, let's begin with you. You actually say there <<COULD>> <<PROBABLY>> not really be health care reform without a public option. How do you define what the public option even is?"

        "statement": "<WELL>, the Northern Alliance are in control of <ABOUT> 80 percent of the country. And they have really seen the military momentum sweep so fast, further than they thought and quicker than they thought. And of course, the political momentum is dragging. And so, that's what the focus is on right now. The Northern Alliance President Rabbani came back to capital, Kabul, for the first time in five years yesterday. But he didn't come to say that he wanted to keep his presidency, <RATHER> that he was here to pave the groundwork for peace, that they wanted a broad-based alliance, that they wanted to make it more inclusive than it had been in the past and that they welcomed the United Nations and the United States involvement in trying to hammer out a future peace settlement."

        "previous_statement": "Well, it's interesting to see this come out and confirm a lot of the reporting that had happened at the time where about a year -- a year and plus into this administration there were dozens of White House staffers operating with interim security clearances, meaning they hadn't actually gotten their security clearance but were gaining access to classified information on an interim basis. And the White House could never really explain why that was the case. Why were so many people unable to finish the process of getting their security clearances, and why were -- why was that process being held up for so many people? And it seems that this is the missing piece of this, which is that the career officials were raising red flags about a lot of these people. It was slowing down the process. And then at some point they were waved through despite the objections of those career officials. And I think that's the underlying problem for this White House, they never had a great system to deal with this. There were a lot of people who weren't vetted before they were offered jobs to come into this administration. There were a lot of people who had problems in their backgrounds, who had potential conflicts, who had potential ties to -- or connections with foreign governments that maybe they didn't disclose in their forms, which would have been disqualifying to people in previous administrations who were just allowed to come in because there was such a desperate need for people to work in this administration at the beginning. And I think that that's a really serious question for this administration about access to classified information. In the case of Hillary Clinton's emails, there was a suspicion that maybe she had left it open to foreign governments. In this case it's known that there were people who career national security officials and career clearance officials believed should not have access to this information, were given access anyway, in some cases on an interim basis. Some of these people didn't get clearances, but some of them eventually did over those people's objections.",

What's the right amount of oversight on this? House Oversight Chair Elijah Cummings is going to issue a subpoena, they are going to vote on it today, but he wants to get people to come and testify. How much focus <SHOULD> there be on the security clearance issue?"

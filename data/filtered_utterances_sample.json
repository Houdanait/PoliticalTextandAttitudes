Senior officials traveling with him telling us that he's going to use this opportunity to lay out the deal with Iran that's shaping up as he knows it. Officials say Israel has a great deal of understanding about this deal shaping up. He does not feel, Prime Minister Netanyahu, that Congress has been fully informed, and so he wants to lay out the deal, why he thinks it's bad for Israel, the United States and the world; and also urge Congress to put some pressure on the Obama administration to push back a March 24 deadline for a political framework. He thinks more discussion is needed. He says he's not against any agreement at all, but this is a bad agreement. I do think today, though, he's going to use this address to APAC, that pro-Israel, lobby to lower the temperature a bit, to try and mend fences a little bit with the administration, saying he has a lot of respect for the president, the White House, and try and take out the politically-fraught tone of this speech.

And hello again, everybody. I'm Rick Sanchez. Welcome to \"B\" control. We're going to bring you the news tonight because there is a lot going on in Kansas City, Missouri. That is where there has been a shooting at a shopping mall. Three people are dead, that's including the shooter. Let's take you back now, because we've got a lot of video that's been coming in. Take a look at this. We're letting you hear that just so you can see the emotion for police officers. They get the call this afternoon that there has been a shooting at the mall. It <APPEARS> to be, in <FACT>, a random shooting. Someone who had arrived there and started shooting first outside at a Starbucks cafe, then presumably gone inside the mall. As you can see from some of the pictures that we're getting in, they tried to <CLEAR> all the people who were inside the mall at the time. We're going to be speaking to many of them. In fact, we've been talking to them for the better part of the last couple of hours now. We're also told tonight by some police officials that this story actually have begun earlier in the day. We've got one particular photo. Claude, if we can show them that picture. You're going to see now this gas station. Police officers are now saying they were looking for a specific <SUSPECT>. They found him at this gas station, or at least one of their officers did. The officer approached them, a shootout ensued. The officer was shot, the suspect got away, and then he went to that shopping mall that we have been talking about. But even before all of this, police are now telling us tonight, they have confirmed it actually began early in the morning, before the shopping mall incident, before the gas station incident. That's when they said, they found a body. They say it was a homicide and they say the person responsible is the one who's now ending up at both the shopping mall and the gas station. What a story. We do have witnesses who've been talking to us throughout the course of the evening. Here's one of them. His name is Travis Johnson."

        "statement": "It is Sunday October 3, less than one month now until election day. And if you love politics you'll get your fill of it in the week ahead. There is plenty to talk about today. Hello I'm Kelly Wallace in Washington. Thanks so much for joining us. Politics doesn't take weekends off and neither do we. We have another jam packed hour ahead so, let's get right to it. We begin with the first poll since Thursday's presidential debate. A new survey by \"Newsweek\" shows the battle for the White House is back to a dead heat. It shows Senator John Kerry has climbed ahead of President Bush with 47 percent of the respondents favoring the Democratic senator, 45 percent support Mr. Bush. Just three weeks ago the president led Kerry by six percentage points. When asked who won Thursday night's face-off in Florida, a big majority, 61 percent, said Senator Kerry, 19 percent said President Bush. And the new \"Los Angeles Times\" poll has similar results on who came out on top with most of the respondents saying John Kerry was the winner. The \"Times\" survey also looks at likability. And among those who watched the debate 39 percent say President Bush is more likable, 38 percent say Senator Kerry. And speaking of debates, you <KNOW> this by now, candidates Bush and Kerry have two more face to face encounters. They meet again Friday night in St. Louis and October 13 in Tempe, Arizona. Their running mates meet Tuesday in Cleveland. And with that vice presidential debate just two days from now all eyes are on Dick Cheney and John Edwards. The vice president is not in Jackson, Wyoming. Tomorrow, we are told, he plans to go fishing. Senator Edwards is in Chappaqua, New York, that's up state, where he is said to be engaged in some intense debate preparations. Cheney's debate partner is Congressman Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio. Congressman Portman had the same role four years ago when he was playing Joe Lieberman. He and Cheney, we are told, have practiced on weekends starting in mid-August. And this tidbit of insider information. Portman has honed up on all of Edwards' floor speeches and closing arguments in some of his trial lawyer cases and in his primary debates so Portman can better, quote, \"be Edwards\" in the mock debate. Now to help Edwards prepare for Tuesday the Kerry Edwards campaign has recreated the debate set complete with television cameras. And Washington attorney Bob Barnett is playing the part of Dick Cheney, a role he played in 2000. And this final tidbit for you, instead of standing up at a podium Cheney and Edwards will be sitting down for their debate. And we are told from the Edwards camp that it was the Vice President Dick Cheney who wanted to be sitting down for that. Well, since his first face off Thursday night with Senator John Kerry President Bush is going on the offensive. And he has seized on some of the things Senator Kerry said in the debate. CNN's Dana Bash is with us now from the White House with more on the president's strategy. And Dana, how much of this is damage control after the president's performance Thursday night?"

There`s one experience that I share where my white girlfriends are my <BEST> friends for life, but there was one instance that I experienced at a slumber party <AROUND> eighth grade where the \"N\" word was used. And there`s nothing like that moment where the trust is broken between -- and where you recognize your blackness and how it separates you from these people that you felt so intimately connected to and I still do, to be <CLEAR>. We worked through it and this is someone who to this day is one of my best friends.

It is a collective experience of exclusion that cannot be understood by -- deeply in the same way by someone who has never had to face that same type of discrimination. And so it sounds silly, but like I was laser focused. I was like I`m trying to find the black table at this school, which is Something that I talk about in my book, this concept of the black table. And, really, what the black table is, it`s a safe space where you can just be yourself and where you don`t have to worry about these types of encounters happening, these microaggressions happening. You can just take off the masks and you can stop code-switching and you can just really be yourself."

But the fact that they have managed to get together under the circumstances speak of the good deal of support here for the former king, Zahir Shah.

I think they <SHOULD> be looking at, what is the difference between the 17 percent who <SEEM> to be more aggressive, and the 83 percent who are not aggressive and who seem quite normal?

Those are the key factors to look at. I think we will have daycare. There is still a problem with good daycare. And one thing that no-one pointed out, is one of the problems with daycare is, there's a large turnover of staff, so children make an attachment and they become unattached to someone they're closed to, because people move on, because salaries are so low. I think that's a critical ingredient in whether the children <FEEL> a sense of getting emotional support when they are in daycare, and only a small percentage of daycare, <MAYBE> 5 to 10 percent, is rated high quality by a lot of pediatricians."

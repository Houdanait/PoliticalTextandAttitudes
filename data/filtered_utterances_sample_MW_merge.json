        "previous_statement": "Over the weekend, there was a pretty pathetic attempt at a video production regarding the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson. That was released at a fair somewhere in Texas, I believe. Contained in that was a very poorly edited snippet of a security video taken from the store in Ferguson shortly before, about 12 hours before Michael Brown returned to the store and shortly before he was shot. That has generated some inquiries and questions from the public and the media regarding the content, the source, the origin of that particular video. The video is indeed security footage from the market that night. On August the 14th, the county police during the investigation were advised that Michael Brown had come into the store somewhere around midnight, and according to the employees talking to the police that day, had attempted to steal something. They also indicated that it had been captured on the security video. So we secured a search warrant to obtain the hardware and the hard drive, everything's downloaded on the hard drive or recorded on the hard drive in this entire system. That search warrant, we got possession of the equipment on August the 15th of 2014. The particular video was downloaded in its entirety and we'll have a copy of the entire thing for you as soon as we're finished here. But it starts at about three or four minutes before Mr. Brown and his companions pulled into the parking lot of the store. And it ends about two minutes after he and his companions pulled off the parking lot. It shows four different angles, two from the parking lot, one from each side of the parking lot, one from inside the store, looking from front to back, that covers the customer side of the counter along with the back of the store where the coolers are. And then the fourth one is from behind-the-counter, looking towards the counter itself. In a nutshell, what that shows is that Mr. Brown entered the store, entered by himself, and arrived with other people who never got out of the car, went back to the cooler, got a couple of cold drinks out of the cooler, went up to the -- there is no audio with this, by the way -- but went up to the counter, clearly ordered or asked for a couple of boxes of cigarillos. The clerk put those in the bag along with the drinks that he had. Mr. Brown put something on the counter. There is a discussion clearly going on there. Everything is in the bag. Mr. Brown and the clerks were examining whatever it was he put on the counter. Mr. Brown had a discussion with them, picked up the bag, started to walk out of the store. One of the clerks said something to him or more. He returned, put the bag back on the counter, continued the discussion with them, and then took something off of the counter itself and walked out of the store. The clerks then, as the entire video shows, the clerks then took the cigarillos out of the bag, put them back onto the rack behind-the-counter. Another clerk took the cold drinks back to the cooler and put them back in the cooler. That whole video was examined early on. We were well aware of it. Of course, we issued the search warrant in order to obtain it. It was determined early on -- this is not new, everybody knew about it. It was determined it was neither relevant for material to anything that occurred later that day, around noon in the store, or on Canfield Drive. As I'm sure you recall, I indicated we were putting everything in front of the grand jury that would have been admissible at trial had there been an indictment. There clearly wouldn't have been admissible. So that was not presented then to the grand jury. Which means then it wasn't released. But it's important to note that the conversation that police had with the store employees is documented in the police report, which was released on November 24th. Their application for a search warrant, the discussion about getting a search warrant for this information, is also in that same police report. And ultimately, a description of the content of the video is in that police report. All of which was released on November 24th, 2014, as part of the release that I made that night after the grand jury returned its verdict. So in answer to the question, this is not new information. It's certainly not a surprise to anyone. It's certainly not relevant or material to anything that occurred, as I said, later in the day around noon at the store or shortly after that on Canfield Drive. So that's pretty much the extent of it. We have copies of the entire video. And I think that's very important. Number one, it's documented in the report, so it's not as though this was hidden away somewhere, as this fellow with his video project was trying to say. Well, actually did say. It's documented in the police report. If you look even at his pathetic video, it shows the police report where he got the information. So it's all there. It's been there since December or since November of 2014. It's available. It's not edited. It is from start to finish, from a few minutes before he arrived at the parking lot up until a few minutes after he leaves the parking lot. Those will be available. We'll try to get it up online for",

When they pulled back that rug -- and this was just in the dirt in the wood side by this building outdoors -- then they discovered what appeared to be a polystyrene cork, if you will, in this concrete hole. And it was in this tiny concrete hole, <ABOUT> six feet by eight feet, that Saddam Hussein was hiding. And they say that he came out without a fight, that he came out and he was looking disheveled, and very, very quickly he was taken away. So it was really the soldiers spotting that something didn't look right in the dirt on the ground, something that had been heavily camouflaged, something that had been designed to <AVOID> capture. Something General Odierno said, he said he thought there were <<PERHAPS>> 20 or 30 locations like this that Saddam Hussein <MAY> have had to go and hide in <EVERY> so <OFTEN>, Wolf."

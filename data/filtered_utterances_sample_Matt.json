        "previous_statement": "Over the weekend, there was a pretty pathetic attempt at a video production regarding the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson. That was released at a fair somewhere in Texas, I believe. Contained in that was a very poorly edited snippet of a security video taken from the store in Ferguson shortly before, about 12 hours before Michael Brown returned to the store and shortly before he was shot. That has generated some inquiries and questions from the public and the media regarding the content, the source, the origin of that particular video. The video is indeed security footage from the market that night. On August the 14th, the county police during the investigation were advised that Michael Brown had come into the store somewhere around midnight, and according to the employees talking to the police that day, had attempted to steal something. They also indicated that it had been captured on the security video. So we secured a search warrant to obtain the hardware and the hard drive, everything's downloaded on the hard drive or recorded on the hard drive in this entire system. That search warrant, we got possession of the equipment on August the 15th of 2014. The particular video was downloaded in its entirety and we'll have a copy of the entire thing for you as soon as we're finished here. But it starts at about three or four minutes before Mr. Brown and his companions pulled into the parking lot of the store. And it ends about two minutes after he and his companions pulled off the parking lot. It shows four different angles, two from the parking lot, one from each side of the parking lot, one from inside the store, looking from front to back, that covers the customer side of the counter along with the back of the store where the coolers are. And then the fourth one is from behind-the-counter, looking towards the counter itself. In a nutshell, what that shows is that Mr. Brown entered the store, entered by himself, and arrived with other people who never got out of the car, went back to the cooler, got a couple of cold drinks out of the cooler, went up to the -- there is no audio with this, by the way -- but went up to the counter, clearly ordered or asked for a couple of boxes of cigarillos. The clerk put those in the bag along with the drinks that he had. Mr. Brown put something on the counter. There is a discussion clearly going on there. Everything is in the bag. Mr. Brown and the clerks were examining whatever it was he put on the counter. Mr. Brown had a discussion with them, picked up the bag, started to walk out of the store. One of the clerks said something to him or more. He returned, put the bag back on the counter, continued the discussion with them, and then took something off of the counter itself and walked out of the store. The clerks then, as the entire video shows, the clerks then took the cigarillos out of the bag, put them back onto the rack behind-the-counter. Another clerk took the cold drinks back to the cooler and put them back in the cooler. That whole video was examined early on. We were well aware of it. Of course, we issued the search warrant in order to obtain it. It was determined early on -- this is not new, everybody knew about it. It was determined it was neither relevant for material to anything that occurred later that day, around noon in the store, or on Canfield Drive. As I'm sure you recall, I indicated we were putting everything in front of the grand jury that would have been admissible at trial had there been an indictment. There clearly wouldn't have been admissible. So that was not presented then to the grand jury. Which means then it wasn't released. But it's important to note that the conversation that police had with the store employees is documented in the police report, which was released on November 24th. Their application for a search warrant, the discussion about getting a search warrant for this information, is also in that same police report. And ultimately, a description of the content of the video is in that police report. All of which was released on November 24th, 2014, as part of the release that I made that night after the grand jury returned its verdict. So in answer to the question, this is not new information. It's certainly not a surprise to anyone. It's certainly not relevant or material to anything that occurred, as I said, later in the day around noon at the store or shortly after that on Canfield Drive. So that's pretty much the extent of it. We have copies of the entire video. And I think that's very important. Number one, it's documented in the report, so it's not as though this was hidden away somewhere, as this fellow with his video project was trying to say. Well, actually did say. It's documented in the police report. If you look even at his pathetic video, it shows the police report where he got the information. So it's all there. It's been there since December or since November of 2014. It's available. It's not edited. It is from start to finish, from a few minutes before he arrived at the parking lot up until a few minutes after he leaves the parking lot. Those will be available. We'll try to get it up online for",

We have been hearing a lot lately, particularly from seniors about end of life decisions and things that are stuck in these bills. And part of the problem we have, Heidi, is there's no one bill and everybody, I mean, the reason they have judges is they look at the law because people dispute what the law is about and that is doubly true when it is just a piece of legislation as the people read one thing one way and other people see it in a different way. So there's lots of those sorts of end of life - what is it going to cost me, are you going to come back on Medicare, can I still see my own doctor and one of the things that Republican conservatives want to talk about a lot is how much is this going to cost a nation as a whole.

And that <WOULD> have huge repercussions. That's for the economy and for the oil trade of course. But on the other hand, this is a very dangerous escalation as you said. We have seen the Saudi block and the Iranians facing off in proxy wars across the region in Yemen, in Syria, in Iraq. There hasn't been a direct confrontation yet. It has been playing out across the region through proxies. But it's events like this, like this incident that occurred recently as <WELL> as the one that happened that took place a month ago that continues to just ratchet up tensions in this very volatile region.

        "previous_statement": "Palm Beach has admitted the number of votes in its answer. I don't think that's going to be the issue. The real issue is the legal issue of first, was there a requirement under the Supreme Court's order that the 189 votes that had been certified, additional net votes for Al Gore, that had been certified at 5 p.m., should be included or not. The second issue is the votes that were counted in 127 minutes after 5 PM. Now, first we think those should have been certified under Chappell against State, where the Florida Supreme Court held that a day or two or three missing of the deadline should not prevent those votes from being certified. But whether or not they should have been certified is really not critical to this case, because this is not under Section 166, it's under Section 168. And as a result, as long as those are legal votes, and the court will recall that Mr. Richard told the court that the defendants do not have any problem with the Palm Beach County's exercise of discretion, so I don't think there's any dispute that those are legal votes, under Section 168 those legal votes must be considered. So whether or not they should have been included in the certification or not really is not the point in terms of election contest. In election contest, as long as they're legal votes, they've got to be considered, at this stage in the proceeding, whether or not they should have been included at the certification stage. Now let me turn to Miami-Dade. Miami-Dade is somewhat the same and somewhat different than Palm Beach. It is somewhat the same in the sense that like Palm Beach, Miami-Dade completed a portion of its recount, but not its entire recount. It is different than Palm Beach in two respects. First, while Palm Beach always intended to complete its manual recount and did, Miami-Dade stopped its manual recount before the deadline. That is, it made a decision not to continue with a manual recount. So not only did it never finish, but it intentionally stopped the manual recount. Second, unlike Palm Beach, Miami-Dade did not certify its partial results. Neither of those distinctions, we believe, make a difference at this stage, that is, the election contest stage, because again, the issue before the court is: Is there or are there legal votes that have been rejected? And whether or not the votes identified in the Miami-Dade recount were or were not certified, those are still legal votes that should be considered in this election contest. So that the fact that those votes exist is what is important, not whether or not they were certified, and not even whether or not they should have been certified. The second issue with respect to Miami-Dade are the approximately 9,000 votes that have never been manually counted, even once. With respect to Broward County and Palm Beach County, all of the votes were properly counted, or at least all of the votes were manually counted. There's an issue, as the court knows, with respect to Palm Beach as to whether or not the right standard was applied. But all of the votes were counted once in Broward and in Palm Beach. In Dade, approximately 20 percent of the undervotes were counted. But approximately 80 percent have never been counted at all, and that's the so-called 9,000 ballots that we keep talking about. So that the second issue with respect to the Palm Beach -- excuse me -- with respect to the Dade County ballots is: Should those votes be counted? We believe those votes should be counted. We believe that under...",
        "statement": "... in the language of the statute place in <DOUBT> the result of the election sufficiently so that those votes have got to be included in the vote tally. And just as background, in the 20 percent of the precincts that were counted manually in Miami-Dade, the Miami-Dade Canvassing Board identified a legal vote in <APPROXIMATELY> one out of <EVERY> four undervote or nonvote ballots that it reviewed. That is, they got <ABOUT> 20 percent through the ballots that did not have a vote recorded for president. And as they went through those ballots, in 24 percent of those ballots -- that is, <APPROXIMATELY> one out of four -- they were able to identify that the voter intended to vote for a candidate for president and who that candidate was. So that in one out of four of the undervotes or nonvotes that Miami-Dade reviewed before they ceased their manual review, they were able to identify a legal vote for president. Now we don't <KNOW> that that percentage will exactly apply to the 9,000 undervotes or nonvotes that have not been reviewed. But <CERTAINLY>, since that was <ABOUT> the same percentage that Broward County identified, that is Broward County also was able to identify <ABOUT> one vote out of four. When they went through the nonvotes and the undervotes, <ABOUT> one out of four of those votes were votes that the canvassing board in Broward County was able to identify as a legal vote for president and then count it. It <CERTAINLY> indicates that there are a large number of votes in that 9,000. It <WOULD> be <WELL> over 2,000 votes if the same 25 percent recovery ratio were to apply, far more than the number needed to place in <DOUBT> the results of this election, which is the difference, as everybody <<PROBABLY>> in the country and <<MAYBE>> the world knows, is 537. So you have in Dade County votes that have <NEVER> been manually recounted at <ALL> that are sufficient to <CHANGE> the election. The fifth what we <<<THINK>>> is essentially legal issue is Nassau County. And with respect to Nassau County, you have a situation in which there were two machine counts. I don't <<<THINK>>> there was any manual count in Nassau County at <ALL>. But what is involved are two machine counts. There was a machine count on Election Day. And then, as is provided by Florida law because the differential was less than one- half of 1 percent, there was a mandatory machine recount. And the statute, as we've quoted to the court, provides that that machine recount, the mandatory machine recount under the statute, is to be the certified result unless there's a manual recount. There was not a manual recount in Nassau County, and the canvassing board did what we <<<THINK>>> is the right <THING> on November 14, and they certified those results to the secretary of state. Now, thereafter, without any protest being filed, and in our <VIEW> without any precedent or justification, they then filed another certificate in which they decertified, if you will, what they had certified before, and went back and attempted to certify the results that came in on the first count on Election Day. Now, first, there is, in our <VIEW>, no legal or precedential basis for doing that. We don't <<<THINK>>> there's any basis in the Florida Supreme Court's decision that <WOULD> allow them to do that. There was no protest filed that <WOULD> allow them to <CHANGE> it. And in addition, as we've pointed out in our papers, we <<<BELIEVE>>> the process by which they did that, which included a person that was substituted onto the board that was, in our <VIEW>, ineligible, and meetings that, in our <VIEW>, violated Florida law, in lack of notice and lack of compliance with other statutes, <ALL> <WOULD> make that certification defective. So with respect to Nassau County, our <VIEW> is that the right votes to be taken into account in terms of this contest proceeding is the statutory mandated machine recount. Now those issues, those five issues, are, in our <VIEW>, <ENTIRELY> questions of law. There is one issue that is, in our <VIEW>, at least predominantly a <QUESTION> of law because we <<<THINK>>> it's a judicial issue for the court, but it is <<SOMEWHAT>> different than these first five issues. And that is the issue with respect to the 3300 Palm Beach ballots that Palm Beach did count that we are contesting. These 3300 ballots are the <ONLY> ballots that were counted by a canvassing board that we are contesting. And we <<<BELIEVE>>> under the 1929 decision, Nutchio (ph) against State, that we have recited in our paper, that is and has been for more than 70 years in Florida, considered a judicial <QUESTION> to be decided de novo by the court. That's also what we <<<BELIEVE>>> that 168 statute makes <CLEAR>. We <<<THINK>>> that this is an issue for the court to decide, but we recognize that that's an issue that is going to be subject of some testimony and evidence today. But in terms of the 3,300 Palm Beach ballots, that is a <QUESTION> that on the one hand the court is going to <HAVE TO> look at what is the appropriate legal standard to apply, and then whether that standard is in the first instance de novo review by the court or whether it is, as the defendants have argued, an abuse of discretion standard. We <<<THINK>>> that those are the key issues that are going to be in front of the court. I'm not going to spend time arguing <ABOUT> how important the right to vote is or any of that; I <<<THINK>>> the court is <WELL>-aware of that. I <<<THINK>>> that our purpose today is to get to the evidence, and get to the legal arguments that will deal with these particular issues. Thank you very much."

In the past month, Streisand's financial support has become an issue in several political campaigns. She's also provided and released one high level briefing memo to House Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt, who's name she misspelled. Now, she has added her deep thoughts to the debate over America's foreign policy. In a statement issued yesterday, Miss Streisand sought to clarify the nuances of her position saying that she remains deeply opposed to -- quote -- \"the Iranian dictator, Saddam Hussein.\" The news was met with relief by French President Vladimir Putin as well as by the British Prime Minister, Pope Paul John",

And the debating is not over yet. From previews to post-debate reacts, CNN is going to bring you the second presidential debate, as well. Our coverage starts Friday night at 7:00 Eastern, live, as you've come to expect, from St. Louis. No weapons of mass destruction in Iraq -- that's the final word from the chief U.N. -- or, pardon me -- U.S. weapons inspector, Charles Duelfer. He delivers a 1,500 page report to the Senate Armed Services Committee today. Senior administration officials say the findings are going to show former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had no stockpiles at the time of the U.S. invasion last year, but that Saddam Hussein did want to reconstitute his weapons program if international sanctions ended. As you know, President Bush's main argument for war was that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Another of the Bush administration's prewar allegations is coming into question now. There's a new CIA report. It says that it has found at this point no conclusive evidence that Saddam Hussein harbored Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He is the militant believed to have masterminded many of the suicide bombings, the kidnappings and the beheadings that we've been seeing in Iraq. Before the war, the Bush administration had portrayed Zarqawi as al Qaeda's link to Saddam Hussein. Now, adding to all of this, the Bush administration is now having to defend itself against comments from Paul Bremer, the former U.S. civilian administrator in Iraq himself. Senior Pentagon correspondent Jamie McIntyre has these details.",
        "statement": "Former Iraq administrator Paul Bremer now admits what critics have been saying for a year and a half -- the U.S. did not send enough troops to Iraq to keep the peace. Bremer is quoted in a press release as saying, \"We <NEVER> had enough troops on the ground.\" That from an insurance group Bremer addressed Monday. And in remarks at DePaul University last month that drew little attention at the time, Bremer went even further, telling a student forum, \"The one <THING> that <WOULD> have improved the situation <WOULD> have been having more troops in Iraq at the beginning and throughout.\" Bremer's second guessing is political dynamite and was seized on by John Kerry to buttress his argument the war plan was flawed."

He wasn't kidding. He blocked trade ties with Ankara halting chartered flights and banning Turkish workers. The Russian Defense Ministry released this video saying it proves the Turkish leader and his family profited from the sale of ISIS oil in Syria and Iraq, an allegation President Erdogan denied. (on camera): For months it seemed the bitterness between Putin and Erdogan, his Turkish counterpart would never heal. The two were at odds over Syria, but it had become personal too, a battle of wills between two autocratic hardliners. But then suddenly something changed. Perhaps it was economic necessity. But the Turkish president unexpectedly move to heal with the rift with the kremlin expressing regret to the families of the pilot who was killed in the shoot down. Putin quickly responded by lifting sanctions and beginning what he said was a process of normalizing trade ties. A summit in St. Petersburg is meant to cement that rekindled partnership. (voice-over): But its timing after a failed military coup against President Erdogan last month has given the meeting extra significance with the Turkish crackdown on opponents, relations with the west are strained, presenting the kremlin with an opportunity.

Nader says: \"You know, the two parties are still converging. They don't even debate the military budget anymore. I really thinks there needs to be more competition from outside the two parties.\" Nader, who is 73 now, thinks Democrats can win in 2008, unless, of course, they screw up. In a line that is far superior to any of his campaign slogans, Nader says this: \"Democrats have become very good at electing very bad Republicans.\" Nader had particularly harsh words for Hillary Clinton, calling her \"a political coward.\" As for a potential Independent run by Michael Bloomberg, Nader called the New York mayor \"interesting, but unpredictable\" and acknowledged that Bloomberg's money would make it much easier for him to get on the ballots around the country. If he runs, Nader says he would talk about the ever increasing corporate power in our society and the disconnect between the growing economy and the distribution of wealth. When it comes to Iraq, Nader thinks the U.S. should pull all of its troops over a six month period and then have the United Nations sponsor new elections.

The woman was working with Doctors Without Borders in Sierra Leone when she caught the disease. No details were released about her treatment. And in the United States, 43 people who had contact with Thomas Eric Duncan have been given a clean bill of health. Duncan is the Liberian man who died of Ebola in Texas. None of the 43 is showing symptoms, including Duncan's fiancee. Isha Sesay is joining us now from Nigeria. She has been tracking closely the developments there. And Isha, it's fantastic to see you this evening. Nigeria is really being held up as an example of how we can get in front of this.",

One World Health Organization official described Nigeria's victory over Ebola as a \"spectacular success story.\" The director of the World Health Organization, Margaret Chan, said if Nigeria, a country with serious security issues, can defeat this disease, than other countries, too, can have victory when it comes to dealing with importations of the disease. Now, let's be <CLEAR>, though. Nigeria was really looking at something like 20 to 21 cases total in this country, which led to something like 7 deaths. It's hard to make direct comparisons with the worst-affected countries of Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia, because Nigeria does have a comparatively more robust health care system. So, that <MUST> be laid out right at the outset. But there's no taking away from the Nigerian government that their response to that initial first case here in the country back in July was one of swiftness. It was a swift, coordinated response. What we saw was the Nigerian government, federal authorities alongside state officials, state government officials, and international aid organizations <ALL> coming together, Maggie, coming together to ensure that they got that whole issue of contact tracing correct. Maggie, you and I have talked a great deal <ABOUT> the necessity of getting this right, finding those individuals that have had direct or indirect contact with a patient, individual known to have Ebola, taking them out of the general population, isolating them, and treating them. And <EVERYONE KNOWS> that is one of the keys to getting this outbreak under control. It is something Nigeria was able to do extremely <WELL> in part because they were able to convert their health surveillance system, which had been built for polio, they converted that to work for Ebola. So, that was one of the reasons they were able to get ahead of this. And of course, Maggie, we <MUST> point out that Nigeria also mounted a very, very strong, effective communication system to communicate with the general public and those that had come into contact with Patrick Sawyer, that man who brought Ebola to Nigeria. So, a lot to be learned from what they did here in this country. I had the opportunity to speak to the senior special assistant to the president on public affairs, Dr. Doyin Okupe.

If I were a Republican, this is what I would do. As opposed to attacking Colin Powell, a war hero, you know, a leader whether you're a Democrat or Republican, a well-respected leader in this country, as opposed to attacking him, I would sit back, invite him in, and have a conversation with him about what the party can do better to fix this perception that's out there because clearly the perception is out there. Look, I did a poll last year for an organization looking at African- American issues and what came out sort of correlated strong with unfavorable ratings for Republican Party among African-Americans was the idea that the Republican Party was openly hostile to their community and their leaders. That's a real issue. And to act as though there's no racial aversion in the Republican Party I think is a conversation that is silly because we clearly know there is. In fact, I'm going to write a book about it shortly. However, I would take Colin Powell. I would invite him over to the RNC.

Now, of course, this is 10-year-old testimony that's been sealed for a long time. But I want to read you some of the details because they're really important. This is a deposition. He was answering questions from the attorneys. Here is one of them. He said -- the attorney asked him, when you got the Quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these Quaaludes for young women you wanted to have sex with? Bill Cosby says yes. Then he's asked, you gave them to other people. He says yes again. Later on in the deposition though, he's asked this, did you ever give any of those young women the Quaaludes without their knowledge? And his attorney interrupts, he objects, he does not allow Bill Cosby to answer this <QUESTION> even though it's asked several different times, which is important, of course, in the context of, you <KNOW>, giving someone Quaaludes is one <THING>, without their knowledge is different <THING>, especially in light of the rape allegations. I want to read you <A LITTLE> more. He talks <ABOUT> meeting a woman in Las Vegas and he says, she meets me backstage, I give her Quaaludes, we then have sex. Again, admitting to for the first time after so many years of denying everything, admitting to something even if it's not the rape, or any of these rapes. Now, Bill Cosby's attorney is speaking out today saying, quote, the <ONLY> reason Mr. Cosby settled, and he's talking <ABOUT> the lawsuit where this came from, is because it <WOULD> have been embarrassing in those days to put <ALL> of those women on the stand and his family had no clue. That <WOULD> have been very hurtful. You <<COULD>> <<GUESS>> that what they're talking <ABOUT> is some <<SORT OF>> admission of <<MAYBE>> affairs but nothing that amounts to rape."

The surge comes as dilapidated, dirty and unsafe conditions have been found at some detention centers, according to a report by the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security. Just last month, another child migrant died in U.S. custody. That is six child deaths in less than a year. Taking care of migrant children is now a billion-dollar industry. And one nonprofit is dominating that market. Southwest Key Programs has been awarded $955 million worth of federal contracts to run shelters since 2015. But it`s faced federal investigations over alleged financial impropriety. Reporter Nicholas Kulish has written about this and is joining me from New York.

He is now represented by the Government Accountability Project, and he is coming to us from California. So, gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.

From the beginning, we reported our concerns that detention of children, regardless of the conditions of confinement is harmful to their health. But in addition, we observed systemic problems in meeting their complex needs. We found problems recruiting and retaining qualified pediatricians, pediatric mental health experts, there were problems acquiring interpretation. Many of these children speak indigenous languages and interpretation services are difficult to find, making the medical transaction very fraught and risky. And we found problems across a number of facilities with the physical design of the facilities which often wasn`t well planned to keep children safe. So, in addition to knowing the detention is harmful, we found that the government was having trouble meeting its own minimal standards for the health and safety of children.",

It was about Iranian regime failure, and now it's about American regime failure. The war against ISIS has been suspended. ISIS has been a great beneficiary of this. And we haven't even come to the real military response. Most people think that this was the official response, and that there will be continued actions by Iran, with some plausible deniability. And this is going to be, you know, what's going to happen -- the people who are most likely to get hurt aren't American soldiers on bases. And they're not members of the Quds force.

And as you mentioned earlier, their advanced security team on Tuesday when they're carrying out that reconnaissance mission to try and inspect the site ahead of the arrival of the OPCW fact-finding mission, they came under fire one of these locations and also an explosive device was detonated. But as we understand no one was hurt. We need to keep in mind what the scope of the mission of this OPCW fact-finding mission is going to be. It's not to assign blame. They need to establish the fact of whether an attack took place and what chemical was used, so they do need to get there as soon as possible and it's unclear when that's going to happen. When you're talking about what people there are saying, you know, Rosemary, activists and medical workers that we were speaking to right after the attack were warning that this area is now going to be under the control of the regime. It's going to be very difficult to get, you know, the accounts, the honest accounts, as they say, from people who are there in the area right now because they might feel that they are intimidated. They feel that they're scared of speaking freely in an area that is under control of the regime. These are people who have been living for years until rebel control and they've decided to stay in this area even after the regime took control.

But will you be allowed to apply for settled status further down the line? And that is unclear. And one of the reasons that it is unclear is because all negotiations with the European Union haven't been completed and this whole idea of a transition period and what that contains and what it means legally and what the ramifications are is just unknown territory at the moment. So, very clearly if you are an E.U. citizen who's lived five years in the U.K. prior to the end of March 2019, you can apply for settled status and will be entitled to it. If by the end of March 2019 you haven't been here the full five years as anticipated, you will be given a period of grace to meet that period.

The Haitian government is really functioning on a very low level, if that at best. That being said, it's pretty clear now that there has been a bottleneck of supplies at the airport. Even if they get to the airport, getting them out is slower than it should be. I think there's a couple things at work here and now, we're hearing from one administration official who's saying that they are acknowledging privately that there are some problems, that they are trying to fix and trying to address and that they are aware of. But there hasn't been the priority on getting medical emergency aid in. There hasn't been that priority. They've been trying to sort of get everything in at once. So, they're getting in bulldozers, heavy equipment. They're getting food, which is kind more of a long- term thing, or even something that can -- you know, a several days thing. And they haven't gave -- given a top priority to emergency medical equipment, things that can save lives now. We're talking hours matter, days matter -- you know, not weeks and months later. So, that's one of the problems, prioritizing these things. We've been seeing that for days now. Doctors Without Borders, one of the greatest medical organizations in the world working in disasters, has had numerous planes diverted, end up going to the Dominican Republican. They have to drive supplies across. A mobile surgical unit that could have been out practicing surgery. A group of doctors, Partners in Health, estimated yesterday that as many as 20,000 are dying a day from lack of life-saving surgery. I think those numbers are vastly overstated. That was an estimated and I think it's very, very high, and the U.N. agrees on that. But if it's a few hundred people dying a day from life-saving -- lack of life-saving surgery, that's completely unnecessary if they prioritize better. They need to have somebody making decisions of what planes get diverted. They need to have somebody who has a knowledge of what's on those plane and they haven't had that thus far. And this reliance on -- this -- the U.N. has a rule about every group has to have security. And it just -- it's kind of overstated. I mean, the people out here are not the enemy. It's amazing how well- behaved, how ordinarily things have been given all that these things people have been through. So, you know, there are clearly some very real concerns here. But I think -- I think a lot of this focus on security has been overstated to some degree at this point.",

A Democratic governor, former Republican governor, a former Democratic member of Congress from Arizona who indeed was a close friend of McCain's.

There's going to be a tapestry, if you will, of American political leaders from <ALL> stripes. Of course, it was <ONLY> nine years ago, in <FACT>, this week, where Senator McCain himself was giving a eulogy for Ted Kennedy who died of the same type of brain cancer.

And, Wolf, one <THING> that is not being discussed but <CERTAINLY> is underlying <ALL> of this is who is going to fill Senator McCain's seat? Impossible to replace him, no <QUESTION>, but the man who will be doing that, and he refuses to talk <ABOUT> it with very good reason until next week, is the governor, Doug Ducey, who is right there. I heard him say it was striking, \"John McCain's fight for America isn't over.\" So those words there from the man who will choose, at least the interim, temporary replacement for Senator McCain. <CERTAINLY> that's something we'll discuss in the coming days.

After that, there was talk about a shield law, and there were 91 representatives, 17 senators -- according to The Washington Post -- who co-sponsored or supported that shield law. We're in a very different time now, where it's not a post- Watergate time, it's a post-information-age time. It's a time when people are very skeptical of the media and anonymous sources, where the whole definition of media -- if you are a blogger, do you get protected? If you are a citizen and you go out and you talk anonymously with a neighbor and you try to reveal some wrongdoing by putting something out in the Internet, are you protected? So the questions and the politics around a shield law, now, are infinitely more complicated.",

And the main reason it didn't pass was that too many people in the press were against it. There was total division in the press itself <ABOUT> whether they wanted a shield law. Now, that said, you are <ABSOLUTELY> right, Frank, things have changed. They've changed, in almost <EVERY> respect, badly for the press both in terms of the public <VIEW> of the press and some other new technological questions which have made the definition of who is a journalist more difficult.

And the bassist for that band is Joe Sumner. He happens to be the son of Sting. So it is <QUITE> a he family affair. Now, here at the press conference they had no set list, no play list. They were just feeding off the energy of the crowd. As we just heard, they opened with \"Message in a Bottle\". And they closed with \"Roxanne\". It just wrapped up. People are making their way out. Also, a portion of the proceeds will go to Water Aid for the concert tour. It's an organization devoted to providing clean and safe water to underdeveloped countries. And they spoke <ABOUT> how very important that was to them. <BEST> Buy is the sponsor. If you're part of their Rewards Club, you get the first crack at tickets -- Kyra."

        "previous_statement": "And there are fundamentally five issues that the court is being asked to consider. Two of those issues related to Palm Beach; two of those issues relate to Miami-Dade; and one issue relates to Nassau County. The two issues that related to Palm Beach are: At 5 p.m. on November 26, the time that was specified in the Florida Supreme Court's order, Palm Beach County certified results to the secretary of state. Those were the results of the manual recount that Palm Beach County was in the process of doing, but had not yet completed. And we say that under the Florida Supreme Court's order, those certified results were required to be included in the certified results of the secretary of state, and the Election Canvassing Board. The second issue with respect to Palm Beach relates to the stub or the tag end, or the additional votes that were identified after 5 p.m., because Palm Beach did not finish its manual recount by 5 p.m.; there's no dispute about that. They finished at 7:07 p.m. on the 26th. And there were an additional number of votes identified in the 127 minutes after 5 p.m. on November 26 that the manual recount continued. There is no dispute about the number of votes involved there.",
        "statement": "Palm Beach has admitted the number of votes in its answer. I don't <<<THINK>>> that's going to be the issue. The real issue is the legal issue of first, was there a requirement under the Supreme Court's order that the 189 votes that had been certified, additional net votes for Al Gore, that had been certified at 5 p.m., <SHOULD> be included or not. The second issue is the votes that were counted in 127 minutes after 5 PM. Now, first we <<<THINK>>> those <SHOULD> have been certified under Chappell against State, where the Florida Supreme Court held that a day or two or three missing of the deadline <SHOULD> not prevent those votes from being certified. But whether or not they <SHOULD> have been certified is really not <CRITICAL> to this case, because this is not under Section 166, it's under Section 168. And as a result, as long as those are legal votes, and the court will recall that Mr. Richard told the court that the defendants do not have any problem with the Palm Beach County's exercise of discretion, so I don't <<<THINK>>> there's any dispute that those are legal votes, under Section 168 those legal votes <MUST> be considered. So whether or not they <SHOULD> have been included in the certification or not really is not the point in terms of election contest. In election contest, as long as they're legal votes, they've got to be considered, at this stage in the proceeding, whether or not they <SHOULD> have been included at the certification stage. Now let me turn to Miami-Dade. Miami-Dade is <<SOMEWHAT>> the same and <<SOMEWHAT>> different than Palm Beach. It is <<SOMEWHAT>> the same in the <<SENSE>> that like Palm Beach, Miami-Dade completed a portion of its recount, but not its entire recount. It is different than Palm Beach in two respects. First, while Palm Beach <ALWAYS> intended to complete its manual recount and did, Miami-Dade stopped its manual recount before the deadline. That is, it made a decision not to continue with a manual recount. So not <ONLY> did it <NEVER> finish, but it intentionally stopped the manual recount. Second, unlike Palm Beach, Miami-Dade did not certify its partial results. Neither of those distinctions, we <<<BELIEVE>>>, make a difference at this stage, that is, the election contest stage, because again, the issue before the court is: Is there or are there legal votes that have been rejected? And whether or not the votes identified in the Miami-Dade recount were or were not certified, those are still legal votes that <SHOULD> be considered in this election contest. So that the <FACT> that those votes exist is what is important, not whether or not they were certified, and not even whether or not they <SHOULD> have been certified. The second issue with respect to Miami-Dade are the <APPROXIMATELY> 9,000 votes that have <NEVER> been manually counted, even once. With respect to Broward County and Palm Beach County, <ALL> of the votes were properly counted, or at least <ALL> of the votes were manually counted. There's an issue, as the court knows, with respect to Palm Beach as to whether or not the right standard was applied. But <ALL> of the votes were counted once in Broward and in Palm Beach. In Dade, <APPROXIMATELY> 20 percent of the undervotes were counted. But <APPROXIMATELY> 80 percent have <NEVER> been counted at <ALL>, and that's the so-called 9,000 ballots that we keep talking <ABOUT>. So that the second issue with respect to the Palm Beach -- excuse me -- with respect to the Dade County ballots is: <SHOULD> those votes be counted? We <<<BELIEVE>>> those votes <SHOULD> be counted. We <<<BELIEVE>>> that under..."

Then, with the start of the heating season, where the massive sudden burning of a lot of coal really produce a lot of pollutants in the air as well. As you can see behind me, as you were just saying, the pollution has spread to more parts of China. The Beijing authorities, actually, just issued a yellow alert for smog for the next three days, warning schools to stop all outdoor activities and advising citizens to wear masks on the streets, but things are equally bad in the northeast still. It was much worse, as you said, over the weekend. People complaining about the smell in the air, the irritating eyes and sore throats, but their biggest complaints seem to be against the local authorities who just simply seemed to be ill prepared. The government website overwhelmed as people went there to seek information. Construction sites remain open, producing even more dust in the air. So it seems like despite all these emergency protocols that has been in place for years, the many governments, local governments, just simply slow in executing or reacting. Then, one last thing, John, as you and I were talking, the pollution is not just China; it is spreading across the ocean to where you are, as dust storms sweep a lot of pollutants to the West Coast of the U.S. So, as they say, John, you can run but you can not escape.",

And whether what's happening today has been preplanned or whether it's just the momentum created that people then go out and try to do things, people who feel that they may have had a half-baked scheme in the pipeline, let's go and do it, that's what they've got. And even if they haven't got that, they've got the sense of fear and anxiety, that there will be lots of false alarms. We know that. The IRA used to, you know, explode one genuine bomb in London every six or eight months and there were lots of false alarms in between. In this case, I have to say, it does look ominous because whether these are imitative amateurs or part of an unfolding plot, the effect is more or less the same, that there are lots of genuine security problems. And here is somebody who apparently -- it may have been mistaken identity, but at least one person now is dead this morning, as far as we -- it is reported. And this will obviously heighten the sense of anxiety. It begs lots of questions about our intelligence led policing, which, by and large, has worked pretty well until now; about the role of MI5 in relation to the police, because all of these people seem to be emerging from, as they say, under the radar. That's really quite worrying. And, of course, it begs questions about the safety of big cities. I mean, London is a city of nine million people. Every day three million people come in and three million people leave again. There's no way you can screen all of that. You simply can't. You have to live with a certain level of risk.

It's less about how they obtained that data; it's actually not that difficult to get that data. It's what they're doing with it. And what Iran is doing, according to the Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, in part, is sending emails to voters, intimidating emails to voters, making them look like they're coming from this pro-Trump far right group, the Proud Boys, which we have heard a lot about of late. You read one of those emails; another one we saw said, \"Vote for Trump or we will come after you.\" Now Ratcliffe got himself into a little bit of hot water there because he said that this was done to damage President Trump.

One of the other things, Wolf, that I think will be interesting is you'll begin to hear John Kerry once again talk about a broader war on terror that is not simply focused on al Qaeda and is not simply focused on Iraq, but begins to focus on places like Syria, Iran, and possibly rogue nuclear weapons that may come from Russia or other states. So I think you'll hear a broader foreign policy conversation tonight. And I think you'll hear John Kerry leverage some of the words from Bill Clinton on Monday night, that he would offer a foreign policy that is simultaneously strong and wise. It will be interesting to hear.",

Hospital officials say one woman has died in the wake of Saturday's explosion and a fire at a water park. The 20 year old had suffered burns to 90 percent of her body. Nearly 500 people were injured when a flammable powder blew up over the stage and a fire engulfed partygoers. More than 180 are in an intensive care. Police say they arrested two men: the event organizer and the engineer in charge of lighting and hardware. Both have since been released on bail and have not been charged. So, let's bring in CNN's Kathy Novak for more on this story now. She's in New Taipei where the water park is located. Kathy, I know that the water park was shut down, but otherwise, what do we know about the inquiry into what actually happened?",

We are told by fire authorities that they do strongly <<SUSPECT>> that this powder <OBVIOUSLY> is to blame, but what they're looking in to is precisely how it was ignited, whether it was <<PERHAPS>> faulty wiring, whether it was lighting <<MAYBE>>, it was something as simple as people smoking. But what we're also hearing tonight from a company that once <SOLD> this powder to the organizer of this color play party, and that organizer has told us that the boxes that are used to ship these packets of powder are clearly labeled saying that this powder can indeed become flammable. We saw the results of that in that awful video of exactly what happened here at this water park on the weekend. And now we're facing the situation where there are 200 or so people in <CRITICAL> condition in hospital out of <ABOUT> 500 who have been injured. They're suffering not <ONLY> very severe burns like the 90 percent of burns to her body of that woman that did pass away, but there are also suffering damage to their respiratory systems, to their internal organs, because they've now inhaled that powder, which we <KNOW> to be flammable."

Let me just read read you a statement from the FDA, which had to clean up the things the president said about these drugs being available. The FDA says clearly there are no FDA-approved therapeutics or drugs to treat, cure or prevent COVID-19. That's it, full stop. Whatever the president said, there are no drugs approved right now. Ross, I do want to ask you quickly just because you're on the frontlines. What are you seeing in terms of supplies? What are you seeing yourself and what are you hearing in terms of masks, of gown, of things that you need to treat the patients?",

But with that being said, there's no secret that we are going run out soon. And the reason is actually because these N95s are something that before coronavirus being very rarely used, there're <ONLY> a few airborne pathogens that we typically fight. Tuberculosis, which, in modern times, is very rare, and disseminated shingles. Other than that, we rarely need an N95. So, overnight, things changed. We went from not really needing N95 respirator masks to needing a lot, and that happened very quickly. But with that being said, there is so much that people can do. The average person does not need N95 to walk <AROUND>, to go and walk your dog, to go ride their bike. We <NEED TO> save these for the healthcare providers. I <<<THINK>>> it's great that there was recently a stockpile released and we're going to have more soon. But everyone has to do their part to make <<<SURE>>> that people like us who are dealing literally face-to-face with these patients, when we put a breathing tube down, when we give them medications, this actually aerosolizes the virus and we're at risk for inhaling it. And if we get sick, there's no one to <TAKE> care of you. So I can stress enough that it <WOULD> <HAVE TO> be a priority to get these masks."

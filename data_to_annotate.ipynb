      "Graded Statement Skipped 96:  All right. Let's break it all down, Ana, because it's <QUITE> massive really in its scope here. This is the main chamber. OK. Kilauea, we've seen <OF COURSE> the plumes. The fissures that are opening up are releasing this energy from underground are good 20, 25 miles away., So the lava that was in the main chamber has been draining. It's been making its way underground for that 20 or 25 miles. So let's break this down, too. Each time we have one or what's leading up to these are the tremors. We've had hundreds of them. Many <AROUND> the summit and then on the east rift. And this is where the fissures have been opening up. Now we <THOUGHT> we had number 18 today. Hawaii Volcano Observatory said no, it's just 17. Because officially to have a fissure it needs to emit lava. So you can have the smoke, you can have the pressure and the gas. But it needs to emit lava. This is Leilani Estate. These are where the homes are. Notice we've got evacuation zones, we've got road closures. The green triangles are all the fissures. Now over the weekend and last week, there was no rhyme or reason to them. We've had a couple on Thursday that were to the southwest and a couple of more to the northeast. But these weekends have been the furthest to the east that we have seen which tells you that this is traveling underground until it gives. So as this lava is released, it is draining the main chamber. That's important to <KNOW> here. Take a look at this imagery that we've got from the USGS. It's a camera that looks down into the caldera. As the lava drops, which was at the top, it releases pressure so there's like landslides. There's debris that falling inside. Here is the lava on April 23rd. Now this is important because there is a fear that we <COULD> have a steam driven, massive, violent eruption if this lava drops all the way down to the water table which is at 1500 feet. Right now the lava is down almost 1200. A couple of feet a day. Another near little 3D imagery, technology is amazing here. From the USGS. they can tell us from using their high-tech cameras what this caldera or this chamber is actually shaped like. And it's getting down and tapering at the end which means debris is coming down which is going to cause pressure but it's also like packing a cannon. And when this thing goes, it's going to blow. Let's take a look another 3D area and you'll get an idea of exactly what we've been watching. So as the fissures again release the magma, we'll see the magma in the main chamber drop. If it gets down to this water level here, with all that debris inside, it doesn't mean it's going to happen but the elements are there. And if they interact just perfectly, this is where a massive eruption could occur like it did in 1924 where you had boulders that were eight tons, you know, size of a car, to 14 tons. Ana, that's like a semi tractor trailer truck that were blown a good half mile to even a mile away. So it's dropping quickly. It's a big concern. The more fissures that are expected, which will most likely happen, will drain more of that lava from the main caldera or that main chamber. So it's a little frightening but the tremors are going to continue to occur as this activity continues.\n",

This is going to be a category 1 hurricane when it hits. I actually spoke to a business owner here last night who told me that about 11 years ago, the last time they got a direct hit in this area, the water in a nearby marina got so high that it sent several boats straight into this neighborhood. Despite that, he says he's going to try to stay open today. He's going to try to keep his restaurant open. He says they have sandbag and they've made several plans to try to stay open throughout the day. It were up to Governor Rick Scott, he'd have that guy stay home. <OBVIOUSLY>, the concern here is that there <MAY> be some complacency. <THINK> about it, Florida hasn't gotten a direct hit from a hurricane in about ten years. From the looks of it right now, it doesn't <SEEM> like a lot of people are going to stick <AROUND> to see what hurricane Hermine does here, Alisyn.\"}\n",

I've been in contact with his attorney, Donald Sterling's attorney, Maxwell Blecher, this afternoon via e-mail. Blecher said he is not denying a new report that the Clippers owner is suing the NBA for damages in excess of $1 billion. His office tells us they <MAY> have something posted on their website shortly. Now, does all of this mean he's contesting the sale of the Clippers? <MAYBE>. Maybe not. Earlier today Maxwell Blecher had told us Sterling would look at the sale of the Clippers to Steve Ballmer and decide where to go from there, saying, quote, \"He doesn't want to fight with Shelly. That's the bottom line.\" That's a quote from Max Blecher to me on the phone earlier today. I don't <KNOW> what the lawsuit means versus what he said to me about contesting the sale, Wolf. Another key piece of news we have today. Sources telling us the doctors have determined Donald Sterling to be mentally incapacitated. This was a finding by two independent doctors, neurologists, presumably, we <BELIEVE>, earlier this month in two different examinations. And we have learned from one source that there is a clause in the trust between Donald and Shelly Sterling that says if one of them were to become mentally unfit, then the other would be the sole trustee. And that presumably opened the door for her to negotiate that sale with Steve Ballmer. Again, I tried to get reaction. I did get reaction from Maxwell Blecher to that finding. He said that's a vast overstatement of mental incapacitation. That this was a diagnosis really of, quote, \"modest mental impairment.\" And that maybe something akin to just slowing down mentally.

The company now says it will give workers another pay raise. About 67 percent. Last week, Foxconn gave out 30 percent raises. Workers will make about $293 a month. U.N. Security Council set to vote today on a resolution that will slap Iran with a fourth round of sanctions. It's all designed to keep Iran from developing nukes, among other things. It would prohibit Iran from buying several categories of weapons, including attack helicopters and missiles. It would bar Iran from pursuing any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and freeze the assets of 40 Iranian companies owned, controlled, or acting on behalf of the Islamic revolutionary guard.

These sanctions will bite <CERTAINLY> the dozens of people named in the sanctions resolution, and it will also put a little bit more of a noose <AROUND> some members of the regime and its ability to purchase large weapons systems and it gives some states -- well, they can now board ships on the high seas that they believe have reasonable cause to be shipping technology apart for Iran's nuclear ballistic missile program. But there are also critics of the resolution, like with many U.N. resolutions, you can interpret them many different ways. The U.S. had to water down some aspects of what it really wanted in order to get China on board, and it will not be a unanimous vote. Either Brazil, Turkey, or Lebanon, or all three will need to vote no or abstain. Still, for the U.S., it's a diplomatic victory, but as you mentioned, Kyra, really what doesn't achieve in the short or long run?

Israel says it was -- quote -- \"targeting Islamic Jihad,\" and this did not amount to a violation of the truce. Let me just fast-forward to later in the day. Here it was.

And then in the United States, we got a rash of economic information all pointing to the down side, whether it was an increase in jobless claims, a regional report on manufacturing that was horrendous, frankly, and also consumer inflation kicking up ever so slightly and existing home sales down 3.5 percent. You've got all sectors there pointing to the down side. And that's what put fear into the marketplace. But what's interesting is people did step in at the end of the day and sort of -- that's what they call bottom fishing, looking for good prices for stocks. So that's actually a good sign that there are buyers out there in the marketplace. There's plenty of cash on the sidelines. But we had some bad news, also, at the bread -- at the end of the day, at the -- at the close, coming from Hewlett-Packard, now saying that they're not going to be selling PCs. They've -- they're not going to be selling their touch pad anymore. They cut their sales <VIEW> and that stock was down about 7 percent right at the -- at the word of that news. But again, you know, all that glitters is gold. People have stepped into the marketplace and picked up gold once again. It's up $34 right now, at $1,828. The guys I talked to were looking for $2,000 in the near term, which, frankly, is <QUITE> amazing. Also, one other bit of news that was a little frightening in the marketplace is that a Swedish financial regulator stepped in to scrutinize the U.S. operations of -- of the European's largest lenders and said it won't take much for inter-bank lending to freeze. That is <CERTAINLY> not anything that any of us want to hear in the near-term. So, Max, it was a very volatile day.

I`m Carl Azuz with your down the middle explanation of world events. Today that begins with Iran and the United States. Two countries that are trying to ratchet up pressure on each other. On Wednesday Iran announced that it would partially pull out of an international nuclear deal from 2015. That deal was made between Iran and six other countries led by Americas Obama administration. Last year, the Trump administration announced the U.S. would leave the agreement. And yesterday, exactly a year later, Iran said it would reduce what it called its commitments to the deal but not fully leave it. Specifically the Middle Eastern country says it plans to hold on to some components of its controversial nuclear program. That`s instead of selling them to other nations as Iran agreed to do under the deal. What the 2015 agreement intended to do was limit Iran`s nuclear program and allow inspectors to make <SURE> Iran was doing that. In exchange, the U.S. and other countries would lift their sanctions on Iran, allowing tens of billions of dollars to flow into its economy. Today, the Trump administration wants to get Iran to negotiate a deal that American officials say is more favorable to the U.S. And until Iran does that, the White House plans to continue applying pressure that it says <COULD> cripple Iran`s economy. After Iran`s announcement that it would back away from some terms of the nuclear deal, the Trump administration announced new penalties that aim to limit Iran`s sales of steel, aluminum, and cooper; a major source of international revenue for the nation. Analyst say both the U.S. and Iran are doing all of this to try to get the international community to pick sides. The U.S. wants other countries to join it in leaving the nuclear deal and pressuring Iran to change its behavior. Iran wants other countries to join it in defying the U.S. and preserving the nuclear deal. Ten second trivia, which of these is not the name of a transportation network company that provides ridesharing services? Juno, Lyft, Via, Appia. Though Via Appia is the name of an ancient Roman road, the word Appia is not a ride sharing service. At least not yet. <OF COURSE> Uber and Lyft are the biggest ride sharing companies in America and on Wednesday, one day before Uber offered stock for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange, many of its driver`s <AROUND> the world went on strike. And they were joined by some drivers for Lyft and other ride sharing companies. Uber`s initial public offering on the stock market could raise about $10 billion for the company. And it`s offering its veteran drivers a payout of between $100 and $10,000 depending on how many trips they`ve completed for the company. They`ll also have the choice to use that money to buy Uber`s newly offered stock. But drivers who`ve given fewer than 2,500 trips <MAY> not be eligible to receive a payout. And those who went on strike yesterday, in general, called for higher wages and better job security. On average Uber drivers are estimated to make around $19 per hour in wages. Some say it works out to considerably less than that once fees, commissions, expenses are factored in. Uber and Lyft say their drivers are independent contractors. What that means in many cases is that they don`t get the same rights as employees. But Uber also says it can`t succeed without its drivers. The length of the strikes, the timing of them, and the specific demands of the drivers varied from city to city. But this was expected to be the biggest internationally coordinated effort so far against ride hailing companies. The number of drivers who went on strike and the results of the strikes aren`t known yet. OK, we`re turning our attention now to artificial intelligence, A.I.

Now so many areas are susceptible to mudslides considering that there's a lot of steep terrain in the region including in Ventura and Los Angeles County in the southern sections of the state. Locations downhill from the burn areas are most susceptible so a lot of people living in the valleys and it only takes about 13 millimeters of rain in an hour or less to cause this flash flooding and there is several years after the burn event that flash flooding and mudslides can occur.

Pacific moisture streaming in off the ocean. There's Butte County and you can see Paradise in the middle, that has seen rainfall. How much have we experienced already?

This is something that needs to be stopped. We discussed this issue at length and there is a total agreement and understanding between the president and myself that there is a need to stop it.

And that's important for Israel to know. It's important for me to praise our partners for that strength of purpose. <OBVIOUSLY>, there's other parties we have to work with, including Russia and China. In other words, you can't get anything out of the U.N. Security Council unless there is an agreement that the Iranians are not negotiating in good faith and aren't willing to go forward. And so we're sending a lot of time working with our Russian friends, in particular to make it <CLEAR> to them that Iran is showing no good faith. And one of the interesting issues that the Iranians have tossed out in this debate is that they <BELIEVE> they have the sovereign right for civilian nuclear power.

And so we provided, I <THOUGHT>, a very interesting opportunity for them to say, if you want civilian nuclear power, you can have your plant and the international consortium will provide the fuel for the plant and we'll pick up the spent fuel from the plant. And this very realistic and reasonable approach has been rejected by the Iranians. And so I say to our friends in our consortium. I'm not so <SURE> these people really do want a solution. And, therefore, let us make sure that we're willing to be working together in the U.N. Security Council. So that's where we are. We're headed -- we're on the cusp of going to the Security Council.

Let's go to the White House. President Obama is speaking. (\", 'statement': \"Henric Svanberg, and I raised two issues at the meeting. First was the containment of the oil that is still spewing into the Gulf. As I mentioned last night my administration has directed BP to mobilize additional equipment and technology and in the coming days and weeks these efforts <SHOULD> capture up to 90 percent of the oil that is leaking out of the well. Now, that is not good enough. So we will continue to press BP and draw on our <BEST> minds and resources to capture the rest of the oil until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer, that is expected to stop the leak completely. The second topic revolved <AROUND> the issue of claims. As I traveled across the Gulf, I heard growing frustration over the pace at which claims have been paid. And I also heard concerns about whether BP will make resources available to cover legitimate claims resulting from this disaster. So this discussion today was essential. Currently, under federal law there is a $75 million cap on how much oil companies <COULD> under certain circumstances be required to pay for economic damages resulting from a spill such as this. That amount, <OBVIOUSLY>, would be insufficient. That is why I'm pleased to announce that BP has agreed to set aside $20 billion to pay claims for damages resulting from this spill. This $20 billion will provide substantial assurance that the claims people and businesses have will be honored (ph). It is also important to emphasize this is not a cap. People of the Gulf have my commitment that BP will meet its obligations to them. BP has publicly pledged to make good on the claims that it owes to the people in the Gulf. And so the agreement we reached sets up a financial and legal framework to do it. Another important element is that this $20 billion fund will not be controlled by either BP or by the government. It will be put in a escrow account, administered by an impartial, independent third party. So, if you or your business has suffered and economic loss as a result of this spill, you will be eligible to file a claim for part of this $20 billion. This fund does not supersede either individual's rights or states right to present claims in court. BP will also continue to be the liable for the environmental disaster it has caused. And we are going to continue to work to make <SURE> that they address it. Additionally, BP voluntarily agreed to establish a $100 million fund to compensate unemployed oil rig workers affected by the closure of the deepwater rigs. We mutually agreed that Ken Feinberg will run the independent claims process we are putting in place. And there will be a three-person panel to adjudicate claims that are turned down. Every effort will be made to expedite these claims. Ken has long experience in such matters. Including running the fund that compensated the victims of 9/11. And I'm <CONFIDENT> he will ensure that claims are administered as quickly, as fairly and as transparently as possible. BP's liabilities for the spill are significant and they acknowledged that <FACT>. We will continue to hold BP and all other responsible parties accountable and I'm <ABSOLUTELY> confident BP will be able to meet its obligation to the Gulf Coast and to the American people. BP is a strong and viable company and it is in all of our interests that it remains so. So what this is about is accountability. At the end of the day, that's what every American wants and expects. The structure we're establishing today is an important step towards making the people of the Gulf Coast whole again. But it's not going to turn things around overnight and I want all Americans to <KNOW> that I will continue to fight each and every day until the oil is contained, until businesses recover and until the Gulf Coast bounces back from this tragedy as I know it will. One last point, during a private conversation with Chairman Svanberg, I emphasized to him that for the families that I met with down in the gulf, for the small business owners, for the fishermen, for the shrimpers, this is not just a matter of dollars and cents. That a lot of these folks don't have a cushion. They were coming off Rita and Katrina, coming off the worst economy that this country's seen since the great depression and this season was going to be the season where they were going to be bouncing back. Not only that, but this happened, from their perspective, at the worst possible time. Because they're making their entire income for the year in the three or four months during which folks can take their boats out, people are coming down for tourism. And so I emphasized to the chairman that when he's talking to shareholders, when he is in meetings in his boardroom, to keep in mind those individuals, that they are desperate, that some of them, if they don't get relief quickly, <MAY> lose businesses that have been in their families for two or three generations. And the chairman assured me that he would keep them in mind. That's going to be the standard by which I measure BP's responsiveness. I <THINK> today was a good start and it should provide some assurance to some of the small business owners and individuals down in the gulf who I was visiting with that BP is going to meet its responsibilities. But I indicated to the chairman that throughout this process, as we work to make sure that the gulf is made whole once again, that the standard I'm going to be applying is whether or not those individuals I met with, their family members, those communities that are vulnerable, whether they are uppermost in the minds of all concerned, that's who we're doing this work for.

A change in power for one of America's closest and most influential allies in the Arab world, Saudi Arabia. King Abdullah has died. He was about 90-years-old and had been ill for quite some time. The first sign came earlier tonight when Saudi television replaced regular programming with Koranic verses. This is what they are showing now. Mecca, 4:00 a.m. there. Uncertain how many of these people simply have come as part of a pilgrimage and how many turned up to actually mourn the late king. However, observers who had knowledge at the scene tell us the crowds seem larger than they ordinarily would be at this hour. Abdullah's hand pick successor, King Salman is 79 which is relatively young by Saudi royal standards. The path he chooses for the kingdom will be vitally important to the United States, of course, the influence that Saudi Arabia carries in the Arab and Muslim world as well as the economic cloud it holds as the world's leading oil exporter. There is a lot to talk about right now. Nic Robertson is monitoring late developments for us. Also, former CIA officer Bob Baer, safe to say he had seen in all in the region over the years, and on the phone, chief international correspondent, Christiane Amanpour joins us as well. Christiane, let's start with you. Obviously, the king was quite old when he officially took the throne but he was still considered a reformer. Though a reformer in a very conservative context of Saudi Arabia.\", 'statement': \"Well, Anderson, that's right. King Abdullah was king far short of time than he was ruler, really. He was ruler of Saudi Arabia since 1995. <SORT OF> dates back to when his predecessor King Saud suffered a debilitating stroke. So he has been the man that United States and the rest of the world has dealt with for the last 20 years. And he has had several very important initiatives and very thwarted in some ways, relationship with the United States. Back in the early 2000s, for instance, King Abdullah came up with the Arab peace plan for the Middle East. He convinced the Arab league to accept an unprecedented agreement to recognize Israel if Israel would return land that were captured in 1967. Report that hasn't happened but that plan is considered still the basis of what <MIGHT> eventually be a peace settlement, or a big part of it. <OBVIOUSLY>, he was also very, very anti-Iran. Saudi Arabia sort of led that Arab part of the anti-Iran coalition and he has, that has been a real hallmark of Saudi policy over the last 20 odd years or more. And you <KNOW> that Saudi Arabia was not at all pleased with the Obama administration's attempt to sort of have a nuclear deal with Iran or any <KIND OF> agreements like that. Saudi Arabia also disagreed very strongly with the United States over policy towards Syria, Saudi Arabia wanted a Syrian moderate Sunni rebels against Bashar al-Assad to be armed and that caused a huge amount of friction with the United States. And interestingly, Saudi Arabia also refused to take its seat in the security council. It was made to have the Arab seat in the security council and it considered that an ineffective position and didn't take it. So it's a very close ally of the United States but very prickly too.\"}\n",

      "Graded Statement Skipped 828:  Hey, Kristie. Good to see you. You <KNOW> what, sometimes -- well, you know, this time of year you'd expect to see sea ice, right, in many areas across northeastern China. The thing is that this time <AROUND> we're talking about some of the thickest in <QUITE> a long time. Let's go ahead and look at the pictures first of all, and then I'll show you which part of the world we're talking about. So this is an (inaudible) in Lazhou Bay in eastern China, just near Shandong Province. And just off the water here you can see how thick the ice actually is. Well, this is a problem, particularly for shipping because <OF COURSE> both cannot get in and out of the harbor. There are hundreds of boats that are literally stuck in that very thick ice and some of those boats can be permanently damaged because of the ice. Now one of the questions that comes up -- there you see the boats stuck in the ice -- that comes up often is also fishing. What happens with the fishing industry? Well, there's a lot of areas there for fishing that -- where they have fish farms, for example. Well, most of the farmers had actually finished their harvest already this year. Usually they finish that by the end of December. So they don't <THINK> that those areas will be affected. But, you know, you can see it there, pretty significant. Come back over to the weather map. This is a very busy area across northeastern China. We're talking in that northwestern corner of the Yellow Sea, in the Bohai Sea. And right over here you can actually see it on this visible satellite image from NASA the extent of the thick ice, in some cases over 125 kilometers. This is not the thickest that they've ever measures, or the widest that they've ever measured. They actually had more ice back in 2010. So this is the second time in two years where we have something so significant. And you guys in Beijing and Seoul, you know what I'm talking about. But it has been so cold over the last couple of weeks. And that of course has helped create that sea ice that you see there. Minus 4 now in Tokyo. The situation in Japan is going to be more snowfall on the way for you after all the snow that you had over the weekend, also very strong winds expected here as another push of cold air continues to move across the northeastern portion of the continent. This is what it looks like on the satellite as you can see here. Another area I want to talk to you about is as we head farther to the south, this is Indonesia. Over the weekend reports coming out of this area, particularly near Jakarta, of some very heavy rain. Well, this rain I don't think it's really associated to Tropical Cyclone Iggy, that storm is way down here to the south nearing the coast of Australia. However, this time of year we are talking about the wettest time of the year here across this part of world, anywhere from Papua New Guinea, which we had landslides last week, back over toward Indonesia of course, and peninsular parts of Malaysia. So <DEFINITELY> something to monitor. The other thing is, of course, is our Tropical Cyclone Iggy right here off the coast of Australia.

And another North Korean soldier has defected to South Korea. He crossed the DMZ Thursday morning. South Korea's military says no shots were fired during the defection, but a while later, its forces did fire warning shots as North Korean guards searched for the defector near the border. The soldier is now in South Korean custody. In all, four members of North Korea's military have defected to the South in 2017. Prior to this year, there had only been four defections from North Korea's armed forces in the past five years. So we do want to bring in our Paula Hancocks, she's live from Seoul.

As you say, this was 8.04 a.m., 10.30 a.m. -- sorry, 9.30 a.m. The military says that then they saw North Korean soldiers approaching the border, <CLEARLY> looking for that defector to try and stop him. They said they fired 20 warning shots in the direction of the soldiers and just about 40 minutes later, they did hear firing from the North Korean side, but that didn't land in South Korea. So even though there was no direct exchange of fire between North and South Korea and soldiers on the DMZ, the very <FACT> that there is firing taking place would concern many. <OBVIOUSLY>, there's concern for miscalculation a great concern here on the border. And it's something that we are seeing more of. Remember just last month, you saw that defector running across the DMZ, being fired upon by his former North Korean comrades, and being shot four times. He has survived. But we are seeing a significant increase in the number of soldiers trying to defect across the DMZ. This used to be a route that was a rare defection route. It was deemed too difficult, too dangerous. But we are seeing a significant increase in the number that are taking that risk now. Rosemary?\"}\n",

In addition to that, the gunman also wrote that he has been -- started <THINKING> about this attack two years ago in the spring of 2017. That's when he was traveling in Western Europe. And in particular, he says he remembered the terror attack in Stockholm, Sweden. That was where a truck was driven into crowds that killed five people. And he said one of the victims in particular really resonated with him. And he took that attack in Sweden as an attack against his own people, and at that point, really vowed to retaliate.

So, for instance, he set up a meeting after the July 25th phone call, he set up a meeting in Madrid between Giuliani and someone called Andriy Yermak who is one of President Zelensky's closest political aide.

That\\'s the same weapon that nearly killed his wife, Gabby Giffords. He\\'s firing. She\\'s there cheering him on.

The judge in this case, Lloyd Nash has said that he intends to appoint an independent counsel to come in and speak to Caldwell. The person that he specifically plans to appoint is Steve Sitcoff (ph) , a defense attorney here in town who has represented Aaron Sorkin (ph) in the past, in drug-related charges. Earl Caldwell objected to that, so the exact person who will be chosen remains to be seen. The prosecution had also hoped in a separate motion to remove William Jordan, a private investigator who is assisting the defense team. He had helped Mr. Blake there the past on the custody issue involving Bonny Lee Bakley. The judge has denied that motion of the prosecution, so Jordan will stay on with the team.

You still have a lot of temporary layoffs converting into permanent layoffs at this point. You still have lots of small businesses, which <OBVIOUSLY> sustained many of those jobs, never reopening. They're still closed and many of which will permanently stay closed. And this is a fruitful line of attack for Joe Biden. Because people perceive this as Trump's strength. And Trump <CERTAINLY> talks about himself as being the <BEST> -- what does he say? He's the greatest jobs president ever in history. But as Biden pointed out, Trump <MAY> be the first president since modern economic data began to leave office with fewer jobs than existed when he was inaugurated. I <THINK> Biden <SHOULD> keep pressing that. <OF COURSE>, he has a wealth of other material he <COULD> be raising if he wants to make his case to the American voter.\"}\n",

      "Graded Statement Skipped 1087:  Yes, it is complicated, Joe. Thank you for spelling it all out for us. So let's bring in our panel to discuss all of the breaking news. We have CNN politics reporter and editor at large Chris Cillizza, CNN political analyst Abby Phillip, and CNN counterterrorism analyst Philip Mudd. Great to have all of you. Chris Cillizza, Christopher Wray is the name that we now <KNOW> who will be named to the FBI. What do we know of him?\n",

But, Chris, also, let's not lose sight, to your own point. Wray has been out there. He was one of the names and there was political speculation about Christie versus Giuliani, you know, and who is going to get their choice in there. And now we know the name. But as you pointed out, the timing is not a coincidence. We can show the hearing room right now which is the beginning of a two-day affair here where we are going to hear questions asked, and, yes, as Phil Mudd says, Director Coats is throwing a big bucket of cold water on any anticipation about him dishing about talking with the president. But the stakes are real, in part that's reflected by the president's desire to shift attention.\", 'statement': \"Yes. So first on Wray, look, the other thing to remember is why did the White House settle on him, and Phil makes this point, other people told him no, right? This is not necessarily a job everyone is clamoring for, particularly if you look at what happened to the last guy. That's number one. Number two, there are no coincidences in politics. This is my attitude when a politician says, oh, I was just driving through Iowa and I'd just <THOUGHT> I'd stop and meet the local Democrats. It is not a thing, right? The reason they do that is because they want to run for president at some time or they <THINK> they <COULD> be president some time. Same thing here. Even if Donald Trump didn't have a history, not just with reality TV, but in his back and forth with the New York tabloids, a history of trying to manipulate media coverage to make it look more beneficial to him, to change stories, to throw some chum over here, which he does, even if he didn't have that history, I would draw the conclusion this is <CLEARLY> meant to take some of that coverage from Comey, Rosenstein, Coats and all the news that's been out there about that and that will be out when they testify over these next 48 hours. And have some of it be, who is Christopher Wray? What's this pick like? It's a -- it's a card that presidents had to play. I'm not critical of it. Other presidents do the same thing, but he is clearly playing a card here.\"}\n",

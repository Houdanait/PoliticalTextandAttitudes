The work began seven years ago when Senator Rockefeller directed the committee staff to review the CIA cables describing the cables of Abu Zubaydah and al Nashiri. It\\'s been very difficult but I <<<BELIEVE>>> the documentation and the findings inclusions will make <CLEAR> how this program was morally, legally and administratively misguided, and that this nation <SHOULD> <NEVER> again engage in these tactics. Let me now turn to the contents of the study. As I noted, we have 20 findings and conclusions which fall into four general categories. First, the CIA\\'s enhanced interrogation techniques were not an effective way to <<GATHER>> intelligence information. Second, the CIA provided extensive amounts of inaccurate information <ABOUT> the operation of the program and its effectiveness to the White House, the Department of Justice, Congress, the CIA inspector general, the media, and the American public. Third, the CIA\\'s management of the program was inadequate and deeply flawed. And fourth, the CIA program was far more brutal than people were led to <<<BELIEVE>>>. Let me describe each category in more detail. The first set of findings and conclusions concern the effectiveness, or lack thereof, of the interrogation program. The committee found that the CIA\\'s coercion techniques were not an effective means of acquiring accurate intelligence or gaining detainee cooperation. The CIA and other defenders of the program have repeatedly <CLAIMED> that the use of so- called interrogation techniques was necessary to get detainees to provide <CRITICAL> information and to bring detainees to a, quote, \"state of compliance,\" end quote, in which they <WOULD> cooperate and provide information. The study concludes that both claims are inaccurate. The report is very specific in how it evaluates the CIA\\'s claims on the effectiveness and necessity of its enhanced interrogation techniques. Specifically, we used the CIA\\'s own definition of \"effectiveness\" as ratified and approved by the Department of Justice\\'s Office of the Legal Counsel. The CIA\\'s claim that the EITS were necessary to obtain, quote, \"otherwise available,\" end quote, information that <<COULD>> not be obtained from any other source to stop terrorist attacks and save American lives. That\\'s a claim we conclude is inaccurate. We took 20 examples that the CIA itself <CLAIMED> to show the success of these interrogations. These include cases of terrorist plots stopped or terrorist captured. The CIA used these examples in presentations to the White House, in testimony to Congress, in submissions to the Department of Justice, and ultimately to the American people. Some of the claims are <WELL> known, the capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the prevention of attacks against the Library Tower (ph) of Los Angeles, and the takedown of Osama bin Laden. Other claims were made <ONLY> in classified settings, to the White House, Congress and the Department of Justice. In each case, the CIA <CLAIMED> that <CRITICAL> and unique information came from one or more detainees in its custody after they were subjected to the CIA\\'s coercive techniques and that information led to specific counterterrorism success. Our staff reviewed <EVERY> one of the 20 cases and not a single case holds up. In <EVERY> single one of these cases, at least one of the following was true. One, the intelligence community had information separate from the use of EITs that led to the terrorist disruption or capture. Two, information from a detainee subjected to EITs played no role in the <CLAIMED> disruption or capture. And, three, the purported terrorist plot either did not exist or posed no real threat to Americans or United States interests. Some critics have <SUGGESTED> the study concludes that no intelligence was ever provided from any detainee the CIA held. That is false. And the study makes no such claim. What is true is that actionable intelligence that was, quote, \"otherwise unavailable, otherwise unavailable,\" was not obtained using these coercive interrogation techniques. The report also chronicles where the use of techniques that do not involve physical force were effective. Specifically, the report provides examples where interrogators had sufficient information to confront detainees with facts, <KNOW> when they were lying. And where they applied rapport-building techniques that were developed and honed by the United States military, the FBI, and more recently, the Interagency High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group, called the Head (ph), that these techniques produced good intelligence. Let me make a few other comments on the <CLAIMED> effectiveness of CIA interrogations. At no time did the CIA coercive interrogation techniques lead to the collection of intelligence on an imminent threat that many <<<BELIEVE>>> was the justification for these techniques. The committee <NEVER> found an example of this hypothetical ticking-time bomb scenario. The use of coercive technique methods regularly resulted in fabricated information. <SOMETIMES> the CIA actually knew detainees were lying. Other times, the CIA acted on false information, diverting resources and leading officers or contractors to falsely <<<BELIEVE>>> they were acquiring unique or actionable intelligence, and that its interrogations were working when they were not. Internally, CIA officers <OFTEN> called into <QUESTION> the effectiveness of the CIA\\'s interrogation techniques, noting how the techniques failed to illicit detainee cooperation or produce accurate information. The report includes numerous examples of CIA officers questioning the agency\\'s claims, but these contradictions were marginalized and not presented externally.'}\n",

It started really with the capture last week of the close confidante to Saddam Hussein General Amid Hamid Mahmud who his capture, it's not what he told his interrogators, but other intelligence that was developed at the time he was captured that led the U.S. to target a convoy of vehicles that was leaving a compound in Kaime (ph) Wednesday night, a border town right along the border with Syria. The intelligence indicated that they were former senior leaders of the Iraqi regime in that convoy and there was a hope, said one Pentagon official that Saddam Hussein or his sons might be among them. Now, according to sources, a U.S. Air Force Predator drone, armed with Hellfire missiles tracked the vehicles. An AC-130 gunship was also called in. At some point, the predator launched its Hellfire missiles. The AC-130 opened fire and a commando team from Task Force 20, that's the Special Operations force that is targeting Saddam Hussein, also moved in on these vehicles. It's right along the Syrian border, and according to sources, some of the people from those vehicles apparently were trying to cross the border into Syria at the time these Syrian border guards were wounded. It's unclear, again, if that was from the sky or from the ground. One thing, though, the U.S. is checking DNA from the site.

I just concluded a meeting with members of my national security team, including those from our intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement agencies involved in the security reviews that I ordered after the failed attack on Christmas Day. I called these leaders to the White House because we face a challenge of the utmost urgency. As we saw on Christmas, al Qaeda and its extremist allies will stop at nothing in their efforts to kill Americans. And we are determined not only to thwart those plans, but to disrupt, dismantle and defeat their networks once and for all. Indeed, over the past year, we\\'ve taken the fight to al Qaeda and its allies wherever they plot and train, be it in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in Yemen and Somalia, or in other countries around the world. Here at home, our intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement agencies have worked together with considerable success, gathering intelligence, stitching it together, and making arrests from Denver to Texas, from Illinois to New York, disrupting plots and saving American lives. And these successes have not come without a price, as we saw last week in the loss of our courageous CIA officers in Afghanistan. But when a suspected terrorist is able to board a plane with explosives on Christmas Day, the system has failed in a potentially disastrous way, and it\\'s my responsibility to find out why and to correct that failure so that we can prevent such attacks in the future. And that\\'s why shortly after the attempted bombing over Detroit, I ordered two reviews. I directed Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to review aviation screening, technology and procedures. She briefed me on her initial findings today, and I\\'m pleased that this review is drawing on the best science and technology, including the expertise of Secretary of Energy Steven Chu and his department. I also directed my counterterrorism and homeland security adviser, John Brennan, to lead a thorough review into our terrorist watch-listing system so we can fix what went wrong. As we discussed today, this ongoing review continues to reveal more about the human and systemic failures that almost cost nearly 300 lives. We will make a summary of this preliminary report public within the next few days, but let me share some of what we know so far. As I described over the weekend, elements of our intelligence community knew that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab had traveled to Yemen and joined up with extremists there. It now turns out that our intelligence community knew of other red flags; that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula sought to strike not only American targets in Yemen, but the United States itself. And we had information that this group was working with an individual who was known -- who we now know was in fact the individual involved in the Christmas attack. The bottom line is this: the U.S. government had sufficient information to have uncovered this plot and potentially disrupt the Christmas Day attack, but our intelligence community failed to connect those dots which would have placed the suspect on the no-fly list. In other words, this was not a failure to collect intelligence, it was a failure to integrate and understand the intelligence that we already had. The information was there, agencies and analysts who needed it had access to it, and our professionals were trained to look for it and to bring it all together. Now, I will accept that intelligence, by its nature, is imperfect, but it is increasingly clear that intelligence was not fully analyzed or fully leveraged. That\\'s not acceptable, and I will not tolerate it. Time and again we\\'ve learned that quickly piecing together information and taking swift action is critical to staying one step ahead of a nimble adversary, and so we have to do better, and we will do better, and we have to do it quickly. American lives are on the line. So I made it clear today to my team, I want our initial reviews completed this week. I want specific recommendations for corrective actions to fix what went wrong. I want those reforms implemented immediately so that this doesn\\'t happen again and so we can prevent future attacks. And I know that every member of my team that I met with today understands the urgency of getting this right, and I appreciate that each of them took responsibility for the shortfalls within their own agencies. Immediately after the attack, I ordered concrete steps to protect the American people; new screening and security for all flights, domestic and international; more explosive detection teams at airports; more air marshals on flights; and deepening cooperation with international partners. In recent days, we\\'ve taken additional steps to improve security. Counterterrorism officials have reviewed and updated our terrorist watch list system, including adding more individuals to the no-fly list. And while our review has found that our watch-listing system is not broken, the failure to add Abdulmutallab to the no-fly list shows that this system needs to be strengthened. The State Department is now requiring embassies and consulates to include current visa information in their warning on individuals with terrorist or suspected terrorist connections. As of yesterday, the Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, is requiring enhanced screening for passengers flying into the United States from or flying through nations on our list of state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest. And in the days ahead, I will announce further steps to disrupt attacks, including better integration of information and enhanced passenger screening for air travel. Finally, some have suggested that the events on Christmas Day should cause us to revisit the decision to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. So let me be clear. It was always our intent to transfer detainees to other countries only under conditions that provide assurances that our security is being protected. With respect to Yemen in particular, there\\'s an ongoing security situation which we have been confronting for some time, along with our Yemeni partner. Given the unsettled situation, I\\'ve spoken to the attorney general and we\\'ve agreed that we will not be transferring additional detainees back to Yemen at this time. But make no mistake, we will close Guantanamo prison, which has damaged our national security interests and become a tremendous recruiting tool for al Qaeda. In fact, that was an explicit rationale for the formation of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. And as I\\'ve always said, we will do so -- we will close the prison in a manner that keeps the American people safe and secure. Our reviews and the steps that we\\'ve taken and will continue to take go to the heart of the kind of intelligence and homeland security we need in the 21st century. Just as al Qaeda and its allies are constantly evolving and adapting their efforts to strike us, we have to constantly adapt and evolve to defeat them, because as we saw on Christmas, the margin for error is slim and the consequences of failure can be catastrophic. As these violent extremists pursue new havens, we intend to target al Qaeda wherever they take root, forging new partnerships to deny them sanctuary, as we are doing currently with the government in Yemen. As our adversaries seek new recruits, we\\'ll constantly review and rapidly update our intelligence and our institutions. As they refine our tactics, we\\'ll enhance our defenses, including smarter screening and security at airports, and investing in the technologies that might have detected the kind of explosives used on Christmas. In short, we need our intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement systems and the people in them to be accountable and to work as intended, collecting, sharing, integrating, analyzing and acting on intelligence as quickly and effectively as possible to save innocent lives, not just most of the time, but all of the time. That\\'s what the American people deserve. As president, that\\'s exactly what I will demand. Thank you very much. There he is. The president not answering reporters\\' questions, but making his frustration very, very evident. The president at one point saying that, \"The failure in the intelligence community is not acceptable.\" He says, \"I will not tolerate it.\" He says more recommendations are coming forward within the next week. He will share those with the American public. But clearly, David Gergen, this president is angry right now over what happened on Christmas Day in Detroit.', 'statement': \"We rarely see Barack Obama smolder, but he was today. I don't <<<THINK>>> I've seen him <QUITE> that <<SORT OF>> intense and <<SORT OF>> angry. I did not find much new that was substantive, as we said before he came out. What was surprising to me, at least, was how much he put on the intelligence failure than on the screening and who gets on planes and who doesn't. The anger is clearly directed not at the CIA, by the way, but at the whole intelligence assessment, where they connect up the dots.\"}\n",

We've done it once before in my tenure on this committee, when you chaired the committee a number of years ago. It was a very exciting time for the committee and I look forward to working with you to achieve that <REALITY>. Let me also join with Senator Sarbanes and Senator Biden in commending you and our former colleague Senator Nunn for the efforts on the Nunn-Lugar approach. You and I have talked <ABOUT> this on several occasions over the last year or so, and I'm heartened to hear you raise this again as such a priority. I <<<THINK>>> it's critically important and still time for us to make a difference in this area. And Dr. Rice, I appreciate your response to Senator Lugar's <QUESTION> in expressing a strong interest to see the ideas that Senator Lugar has offered, ones you <<COULD>> endorse and support and urge the president to do as <WELL>. Let me also join Senator Hagel in -- this is a transformational time, as you talked <ABOUT>, for American foreign policy. We'd be remiss in this committee if we did not express our deep <<SENSE>> of gratitude to Colin Powell and Richard Armitage and the staff they put together. He's been a tremendous public servant and whatever else life holds for him, he deserves our commendation for the job he's done for our nation. So we thank him for that, as <WELL>. And I want to thank my colleagues for raising some of the issues they have. <OBVIOUSLY>, Iraq is a major foreign policy <QUESTION> and rightfully, <WOULD> dominate a lot of our conversation here today. As Senator Chafee mentioned, Senator Chafee and Senator Nelson and I just completed an eight-day trip to Latin America visiting Venezuela, Paraguay, Argentina, Peru and Ecuador coming back. And I want to focus some attention on that in this first round. There are other questions I have. There are <ROUGHLY> 600 million people in this hemisphere, excluding ourselves, who look to the United States for leadership. Two of our <MOST IMPORTANT> trading partners, Mexico and Canada, of course, in this hemisphere. The issues that Senator Sarbanes has raised <ABOUT> economic policy are <ABSOLUTELY> on target and one that we pay -- <SHOULD> be paying much more attention to in my <VIEW>. Because as we found over the last eight days traveling in South America, these issues are the ones they care the most <ABOUT> in many ways. And they're the ones the absence (ph) of our attention to these questions over the last number of years, for reasons they understand. <CERTAINLY> the 9/11 diverted our attention elsewhere, the events of the Middle East have <CERTAINLY> dominated our attention. But I want you to <KNOW> at least my observations over the last week or so is we're in trouble in this hemisphere, Dr. Rice. We're in deep trouble in this hemisphere. Others <MAY> <KNOW> other parts of the world <WELL> and <CERTAINLY> there've been great changes in China and India, Russia, the Middle East, <CERTAINLY> in Africa, but we <NEED TO> get back on track in this hemisphere. And I'm going to ask you a broader <QUESTION> <ABOUT> what direction we're going to <TAKE> here. Let me tell you just briefly some of the things that we found over the last seven or eight days. And my colleagues, Senator Nelson, Senator Chafee can add or detract from these conclusions. We found these governments facing major demands from their citizens with inadequate resources to meet those demands. In <FACT>, the budget indications coming out of the administration are significantly going to provide significantly less resources in terms of aid to this part of the world, and has been the case in previous years. You mentioned the important years of 1947, '48, '49 and thereafter in terms of our efforts to grapple with the great challenge of the second half of the 20th century. <CERTAINLY> one of the great speeches <GIVEN> to set the tone for that was Harry Truman's <ONLY> inaugural address, in which point four, which set up the U.S. aid missions that made a huge difference in the 1950s and '60s. The alliance for progress that Senator Kennedy initiated, these ideas had strong economic components to them as we grappled with the great challenges facing choices in those days between what the Soviet Union offered and what we offered. So we found great demands on the part of the citizens of these countries. We found government institutions that had been weakened and co- opted by unsolved internal political disputes. We found government officials interested in concluding bilateral free trade agreements, not <ONLY> because it <WOULD> improve access to our markets, but because they <KNOW> it can be a means of institutionalizing reforms that'll mean more jobs and incomes to their citizens. We found government leaders concerned <ABOUT> the decline in U.S. resources available to assist them (inaudible) fight against narcoterrorists, terrorists ready to <TAKE> advantage of the lawlessness created by the systemic corruption that exists generally throughout the region, and especially in the tri-border area of Paraguay and Brazil and Argentina where Muslim organizations are <<REPORTEDLY>> raising and laundering monies to support their international ambitions. We found government leaders frustrated by the suspension of U.S. military assistance and training to their military services because of our fixation with the International Criminal Court (inaudible) American Servicemen's Protection Act which links continued assistance in these areas (inaudible) signing of the so-called Article 98 agreement, the United States. And I heard this from American military personnel, Dr. Rice, not from foreigners but our own personnel worried that we're placing so much emphasis on that point, we're stopping the training so necessary to build the relationships in this century to people in that part of the world. We found government leaders desirous of <POSITIVE> relationships with the United States and disappointed that our government hasn't made relations with them a higher national priority. Even President Chavez expressed an interest in improved relations with the United States, putting aside the <OBVIOUS> issue that's going on over the last several days, it's going to be critically important that we try and do something new with Venezuela than the continued policies of isolation, in my <VIEW>. So I'd like to get from you, if I <<COULD>>, as these opening comments: Are we going to have a new direction here in this <CRITICAL> part of the world? Senator Hagel mentioned immigration. No other issue. Vicente Fox, the one issue that he was hoping he'd get some resolution from over the last four years was on immigration, and nothing was done. One speech that I'm aware of, no legislation introduced, no effort up here to make a difference -- it's a crippling economic problem here at home. And it's <<SORT OF>> -- continuing contention between one of our very, very important allies <AROUND> the globe and the closest neighbor to us with some of the <MOST IMPORTANT> issues. What are we going to do <ABOUT> that, and are we going to <CHANGE> some direction here, or are we going to stick with the policies of the past that are creating some serious, serious problems in this part of the world?\"}\n",

So that`s going to be a problem. Another one is going to be her recanting. Brooke later changed her story prior to Charlie`s bail hearing where she took back some of her stories. It`s a well-settled proposition that a witness who is untruthful in one area is to be distrusted in others. And so here we have these two competing stories. There isn`t necessarily good reason to believe one over the other. So that`s going to be a big problem. The other thing that really is a red flag to me is that the police report mentioned there were other people in the home, yet there`s no mention at all about them being interviewed or what kinds of evidence they may have to offer here. That tells me that they may not have seen or heard anything. And that would be inconsistent with Brooke`s story. So there`s an awful lot for defense lawyers to start peeling away at here. This is hardly a slam dunk for the prosecution.', 'statement': 'I appreciate that insight Darren.

Trade deals make it easier and cheaper for countries to trade with one another. They`re not necessary, but there`s a price to pay if you don`t have one. Countries generally slap an extra charge on foreign products when they cross the border. Free trade deals can get rid of these tariffs, pushing prices down and giving customers better access to foreign goods. They can strengthen diplomatic ties. Almost every country in the world has them. Around 230 trade deals went into force between 2000 and 2016, according to World Trade Organization. So, how do they work? Let`s say two or more countries, Country A, Country B, and Country C, decide they want a deal. They gather important people around the table, lawyers, negotiators, regulators, and they hammer out the details. They`ll work out the different sectors they want to focus on and discuss ways to align their industry rules. Leaders give their stamp of approval and generally, lawmakers have to ratify everything. But it takes time. Modern, large scale trade deals between multiple countries can take years to sign and there`s a lot of back and forth. The recent free trade deal between Canada and the European Union took nearly a decade to sign. Even smaller trade deals can often take a year or two. But not everyone is a fan. Critics say it`s better when the tariffs are in place and everyone minds their own business. They say cheap foreign products drown out domestic industry and hurt local jobs.

We heard Lucia talking about how it seems like a dry storm and rather a windy storm for her. But take a look. Here's Havana up here. Here's the center of the storm. You can see most of the wetness is still on the back side of the storm. They're still on the leading edge of this thing. And conditions are going to be getting worse in Havana over the next several hours and the flood threat will continue as we head into the overnight hours for tonight and even into tomorrow. In fact, many locations, into western and central parts of Cuba, could see well over a foot of rainfall from this storm. It's continuing to track up to the west-northwest about 15 miles per hour, still packing winds of 125 miles per hour. So, that makes it a Category 3 storm. It was a Category 4 earlier. We'll tell you the difference in just a minute. I want to talk about that forecast track, because, tonight, the hurricane will be moving back over open water. And while it has weakened now, it's done so because it's moved over land. As it moves back over the water, that warm water, into the Gulf of Mexico, that's the heat engine. That's what provides the energy for this thing, so more strengthening will be expected. The official forecast still has it as a Category 3 storm as it makes landfall, but don't be surprised if we see this pushing back into the Category 4 strength once again, likely sometime in the afternoon on Sunday. If it hits a little eastward, it is going to be later -- or earlier, rather. And if it hits a little farther westward, it will be later. So, really, everybody in this area along the Gulf Coast needs to be on high alert, not to mention all of those folks in the Florida Keys. You guys are under a hurricane warning at this time from the Seven Mile Bridge on westward, with hurricane watch extending on up towards Ocean Reef and then from the Pearl River, extending on the way to the Steinhatchee River. That is where we have the hurricane watch in effect, which means hurricane conditions are expected within 36 hours. Let's get back to that Category 3 stuff, winds at 111 to 130 miles per hour, storm surge of about nine to 12 feet. And this will damage small homes. Low-lying areas, escape routes are going to be cut of hours before this thing already hits. We heard about the Keys, that it's too late for you guys to get out. But it's not too late for you to continue your preparations along the Gulf Coast. You want to do that. You've got time. You have got tonight. You've got tomorrow. But, Sunday, forget about it, as the storm gets a little bit closer and makes landfall. Seeing some heavy showers and thunderstorms over South Florida. Here, you can see a tornado watch in effect. That lasts until 5:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. Hurricanes, especially as they move in the Gulf of Mexico, have a real good probability of producing some tornadoes. So far, we haven't seen any of that. Our primary concerns right now have been tropical storm force winds across the Florida Keys, even into South Florida. Miami, last hour, you had a 50-mile-per-hour gust. We have got 40-mile-per-hour gusts all across the Keys right now. Storm surges throughout the Keys expected to be somewhere between about three and six feet. However, if it deviates from that track and moves a little bit more off to the east, we'll be real concerned about the Keys.

And in particular, he says he remembered the terror attack in Stockholm, Sweden. That was where a truck was driven into crowds that killed five people.

      "Graded Statement Skipped 96:  All right. Let's break it all down, Ana, because it's <QUITE> massive really in its scope here. This is the main chamber. OK. Kilauea, we've seen <OF COURSE> the plumes. The fissures that are opening up are releasing this energy from underground are good 20, 25 miles away., So the lava that was in the main chamber has been draining. It's been making its way underground for that 20 or 25 miles. So let's break this down, too. Each time we have one or what's leading up to these are the tremors. We've had hundreds of them. Many <AROUND> the summit and then on the east rift. And this is where the fissures have been opening up. Now we <THOUGHT> we had number 18 today. Hawaii Volcano Observatory said no, it's just 17. Because officially to have a fissure it needs to emit lava. So you can have the smoke, you can have the pressure and the gas. But it needs to emit lava. This is Leilani Estate. These are where the homes are. Notice we've got evacuation zones, we've got road closures. The green triangles are all the fissures. Now over the weekend and last week, there was no rhyme or reason to them. We've had a couple on Thursday that were to the southwest and a couple of more to the northeast. But these weekends have been the furthest to the east that we have seen which tells you that this is traveling underground until it gives. So as this lava is released, it is draining the main chamber. That's important to <KNOW> here. Take a look at this imagery that we've got from the USGS. It's a camera that looks down into the caldera. As the lava drops, which was at the top, it releases pressure so there's like landslides. There's debris that falling inside. Here is the lava on April 23rd. Now this is important because there is a fear that we <COULD> have a steam driven, massive, violent eruption if this lava drops all the way down to the water table which is at 1500 feet. Right now the lava is down almost 1200. A couple of feet a day. Another near little 3D imagery, technology is amazing here. From the USGS. they can tell us from using their high-tech cameras what this caldera or this chamber is actually shaped like. And it's getting down and tapering at the end which means debris is coming down which is going to cause pressure but it's also like packing a cannon. And when this thing goes, it's going to blow. Let's take a look another 3D area and you'll get an idea of exactly what we've been watching. So as the fissures again release the magma, we'll see the magma in the main chamber drop. If it gets down to this water level here, with all that debris inside, it doesn't mean it's going to happen but the elements are there. And if they interact just perfectly, this is where a massive eruption could occur like it did in 1924 where you had boulders that were eight tons, you know, size of a car, to 14 tons. Ana, that's like a semi tractor trailer truck that were blown a good half mile to even a mile away. So it's dropping quickly. It's a big concern. The more fissures that are expected, which will most likely happen, will drain more of that lava from the main caldera or that main chamber. So it's a little frightening but the tremors are going to continue to occur as this activity continues.\n",

Bloomberg News reports a think tank titled Third Way wants to trim or eliminate Social Security benefits for what they consider high-income retirees. The plan is to boost benefits, monthly benefits, for poorer retirees, while reducing them on a scale starting with individuals who have $150,000 in outside income or couples with $250,000. Social Security benefits would be eliminated altogether for people making more than $200,000 or couples making more than $400,000 in income. The group says people who don\\'t need Social Security shouldn\\'t get it. That is despite the fact that these people have paid into or may have paid into Social Security throughout their working lives. Third Way also wants to raise the retirement age, limit cost-of- living increases -- there haven\\'t been any of those in the last couple of years -- and help young workers create private retirement accounts. Third Way says its proposal will come out after the deficit panel\\'s report and is meant as a kind of cover for Congressional Democrats to support unpopular deficit-cutting measures. Republicans have argued for raising the retirement age, as well as limiting benefits for wealthier retirees. But most Democrats don\\'t want to touch Social Security at all when it comes to addressing the $13 trillion-plus national debt. However, some Democrats do support cutting benefits.

This is something that needs to be stopped. We discussed this issue at length and there is a total agreement and understanding between the president and myself that there is a need to stop it. And we reviewed the different ways how to do it and I'm very satisfied with what I heard from the president and -- on what we agree that we will continue to do in order to achieve this goal.\", 'statement': \"Our primary objective is to solve this problem diplomatically. I've told the American people that I will, on all issues, will try diplomacy first and exhaust diplomacy. And explain to the prime minister that -- about our diplomatic efforts, the most important thing in diplomacy is that there be a shared goal. In other words, you have to have a common objective, a common goal, in order to get people to come together <AROUND> you. And now we have got a common goal throughout most of the world, and that is: Iran <SHOULD> not have a nuclear weapon. And that's important. And we are now working the diplomatic front around that goal. We have a variety of options, one of which, <OF COURSE>, is the United Nations Security Council, if the Iranians aren't willing to show progress toward that goal. We're working very closely with what's called the E.U.-3, that's Germany, England and France. And I've been pleased and Secretary of State Rice has been pleased about their willingness to stay tough on the goal, of achieving the goal. It's -- you <KNOW>, sometimes when you've got a variety of negotiating parties, it's easier for one -- a nontransparent negotiator -- to pick off a weak link. And yet, they have been firm. And that's important for Israel to know. It's important for me to praise our partners for that strength of purpose. <OBVIOUSLY>, there's other parties we have to work with, including Russia and China. In other words, you can't get anything out of the U.N. Security Council unless there is an agreement that the Iranians are not negotiating in good faith and aren't willing to go forward. And so we're sending a lot of time working with our Russian friends, in particular to make it <CLEAR> to them that Iran is showing no good faith. And one of the interesting issues that the Iranians have tossed out in this debate is that they <BELIEVE> they have the sovereign right for civilian nuclear power. And my position has been: Fine, you just don't get to enrich the fuel necessary for the plant. And so we provided, I <THOUGHT>, a very interesting opportunity for them to say, if you want civilian nuclear power, you can have your plant and the international consortium will provide the fuel for the plant and we'll pick up the spent fuel from the plant. And this very realistic and reasonable approach has been rejected by the Iranians. And so I say to our friends in our consortium. I'm not so <SURE> these people really do want a solution. And, therefore, let us make sure that we're willing to be working together in the U.N. Security Council. So that's where we are. We're headed -- we're on the cusp of going to the Security Council. And I repeat to your question: Obviously we'd like to solve this issue peacefully and diplomatically.

Let's go to the White House. President Obama is speaking. (\", 'statement': \"Henric Svanberg, and I raised two issues at the meeting. First was the containment of the oil that is still spewing into the Gulf. As I mentioned last night my administration has directed BP to mobilize additional equipment and technology and in the coming days and weeks these efforts <SHOULD> capture up to 90 percent of the oil that is leaking out of the well. Now, that is not good enough. So we will continue to press BP and draw on our <BEST> minds and resources to capture the rest of the oil until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer, that is expected to stop the leak completely. The second topic revolved <AROUND> the issue of claims. As I traveled across the Gulf, I heard growing frustration over the pace at which claims have been paid. And I also heard concerns about whether BP will make resources available to cover legitimate claims resulting from this disaster. So this discussion today was essential. Currently, under federal law there is a $75 million cap on how much oil companies <COULD> under certain circumstances be required to pay for economic damages resulting from a spill such as this. That amount, <OBVIOUSLY>, would be insufficient. That is why I'm pleased to announce that BP has agreed to set aside $20 billion to pay claims for damages resulting from this spill. This $20 billion will provide substantial assurance that the claims people and businesses have will be honored (ph). It is also important to emphasize this is not a cap. People of the Gulf have my commitment that BP will meet its obligations to them. BP has publicly pledged to make good on the claims that it owes to the people in the Gulf. And so the agreement we reached sets up a financial and legal framework to do it. Another important element is that this $20 billion fund will not be controlled by either BP or by the government. It will be put in a escrow account, administered by an impartial, independent third party. So, if you or your business has suffered and economic loss as a result of this spill, you will be eligible to file a claim for part of this $20 billion. This fund does not supersede either individual's rights or states right to present claims in court. BP will also continue to be the liable for the environmental disaster it has caused. And we are going to continue to work to make <SURE> that they address it. Additionally, BP voluntarily agreed to establish a $100 million fund to compensate unemployed oil rig workers affected by the closure of the deepwater rigs. We mutually agreed that Ken Feinberg will run the independent claims process we are putting in place. And there will be a three-person panel to adjudicate claims that are turned down. Every effort will be made to expedite these claims. Ken has long experience in such matters. Including running the fund that compensated the victims of 9/11. And I'm <CONFIDENT> he will ensure that claims are administered as quickly, as fairly and as transparently as possible. BP's liabilities for the spill are significant and they acknowledged that <FACT>. We will continue to hold BP and all other responsible parties accountable and I'm <ABSOLUTELY> confident BP will be able to meet its obligation to the Gulf Coast and to the American people. BP is a strong and viable company and it is in all of our interests that it remains so. So what this is about is accountability. At the end of the day, that's what every American wants and expects. The structure we're establishing today is an important step towards making the people of the Gulf Coast whole again. But it's not going to turn things around overnight and I want all Americans to <KNOW> that I will continue to fight each and every day until the oil is contained, until businesses recover and until the Gulf Coast bounces back from this tragedy as I know it will. One last point, during a private conversation with Chairman Svanberg, I emphasized to him that for the families that I met with down in the gulf, for the small business owners, for the fishermen, for the shrimpers, this is not just a matter of dollars and cents. That a lot of these folks don't have a cushion. They were coming off Rita and Katrina, coming off the worst economy that this country's seen since the great depression and this season was going to be the season where they were going to be bouncing back. Not only that, but this happened, from their perspective, at the worst possible time. Because they're making their entire income for the year in the three or four months during which folks can take their boats out, people are coming down for tourism. And so I emphasized to the chairman that when he's talking to shareholders, when he is in meetings in his boardroom, to keep in mind those individuals, that they are desperate, that some of them, if they don't get relief quickly, <MAY> lose businesses that have been in their families for two or three generations. And the chairman assured me that he would keep them in mind. That's going to be the standard by which I measure BP's responsiveness. I <THINK> today was a good start and it should provide some assurance to some of the small business owners and individuals down in the gulf who I was visiting with that BP is going to meet its responsibilities. But I indicated to the chairman that throughout this process, as we work to make sure that the gulf is made whole once again, that the standard I'm going to be applying is whether or not those individuals I met with, their family members, those communities that are vulnerable, whether they are uppermost in the minds of all concerned, that's who we're doing this work for.

Walker Lindh told a magistrate judge he understood the charges and that he <COULD> be sentenced to life in prison if convicted. Attorney General John Ashcroft says the United States could seek additional charges that carry the death penalty. In Afghanistan, U.S. Army special forces attacked two Taliban compounds today, killing about 12 fighters and taking 27 prisoners. The Pentagon says an American soldier was wounded, but his injury is not life-threatening. The fighting happened some 35 miles north of Kandahar. And here in Washington, supporters of campaign finance reform say they have collected 218 signatures, enough to force a vote on the issue on the House floor. No date has been set for debate and vote on the bill, which would virtually ban what's called soft money. Those are the unlimited sums that go to politicians.

We'll get to that in just a moment. But now a check at this hour's latest developments: The American accused of joining al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan made his first court appearance today. John Walker Lindh is charged with four criminal counts, including conspiracy to kill Americans. Walker Lindh told a magistrate judge he understood the charges and that he could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted. Attorney General John Ashcroft says the United States could seek additional charges that carry the death penalty. In Afghanistan, U.S. Army special forces attacked two Taliban compounds today, killing about 12 fighters and taking 27 prisoners. The Pentagon says an American soldier was wounded, but his injury is not life-threatening. The fighting happened some 35 miles north of Kandahar.

We've learned a lot here at the federal level: One, there needs to be better coordination between local and state government; secondly, that there needs to be a communications package that will be available to help deal with the situation that happened last time, which was total destruction of communications capabilities; third, that there needs to make <SURE> that there's a law enforcement alternative in case there's a breakdown of local law enforcement; fourthly, there needs to be a prepositioning of assets so that if a major storm were to come, we'd be able to move equipment in faster. But, most important, there needs to be a coordination and an understanding of the evacuation and relief plans. And I talked to the mayor and both governors that I met with yesterday about our seriousness in working with them to make sure that the plans are as effective as possible. The communications, obviously, this time <AROUND> are a lot better than last time around. And so the lessons are being learned. And my attitude toward the recommendations by Fran Townsend, who's a part of my administration, or the Congress, is we ought to take them all seriously. The objective is to respond to these natural disasters as well as we <POSSIBLY> can. The other issue down there for New Orleans, <OF COURSE>, is the levees. And we've got money in the supp to make sure that these levees are pre-Katrina or better prior to June 1st. I <THINK> we'll achieve that objective. There's -- additional money will be spent so that the levees are improved significantly by September of '07. The levees are important to -- the rebuilding of the levees or improving of the levees are very important to assure the people of New Orleans that if there is a storm, they're built to pre-Katrina levels, at least in the initial stage. But also it's important to convince people that it's OK to risk capital in New Orleans. The amazing thing in the area down there -- I don't <KNOW> if you all went with me, but it was -- there's -- it's a <TOTALLY> different attitude from when we were there before early on, obviously, after the storm. I mean, people are coming back. The sales tax along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi are higher today than they were a year ago this date and that's positive.

And Mississippi, the CDBG money will be coming out pretty quick. New Orleans, they still got a little work. The governor has proposed a plan that will be in front of the legislature I think this weekend. It's a very important step to getting this process moving. And so we've got a lot of work to do.

But I think what was very important from a trial strategy standpoint was the opening of the case with Dr. Ziv. Remember, she is the forensic psychiatrist who talked about the rape myths, how women behave after being sexually assaulted. So, they started the case by educating the jury. This is how people behave in the aftermath of these cases and it is not always consistent and it's not like television where they call the police immediately or things of that sort. So, I think the combination of the introduction of forensic psychiatry with his own words and the prior bad act evidence leading up to Andrea Constand's testimony was that which convicted him in this case.\"}\n",

Thanks for joining us. We have breaking news tonight. A change in power for one of America's closest and most influential allies in the Arab world, Saudi Arabia. King Abdullah has died. He was about 90-years-old and had been ill for quite some time. The first sign came earlier tonight when Saudi television replaced regular programming with Koranic verses. This is what they are showing now. Mecca, 4:00 a.m. there. Uncertain how many of these people simply have come as part of a pilgrimage and how many turned up to actually mourn the late king. However, observers who had knowledge at the scene tell us the crowds seem larger than they ordinarily would be at this hour. Abdullah's hand pick successor, King Salman is 79 which is relatively young by Saudi royal standards. The path he chooses for the kingdom will be vitally important to the United States, of course, the influence that Saudi Arabia carries in the Arab and Muslim world as well as the economic cloud it holds as the world's leading oil exporter. There is a lot to talk about right now. Nic Robertson is monitoring late developments for us. Also, former CIA officer Bob Baer, safe to say he had seen in all in the region over the years, and on the phone, chief international correspondent, Christiane Amanpour joins us as well. Christiane, let's start with you. Obviously, the king was quite old when he officially took the throne but he was still considered a reformer. Though a reformer in a very conservative context of Saudi Arabia.\", 'statement': \"Well, Anderson, that's right. King Abdullah was king far short of time than he was ruler, really. He was ruler of Saudi Arabia since 1995. <SORT OF> dates back to when his predecessor King Saud suffered a debilitating stroke. So he has been the man that United States and the rest of the world has dealt with for the last 20 years. And he has had several very important initiatives and very thwarted in some ways, relationship with the United States. Back in the early 2000s, for instance, King Abdullah came up with the Arab peace plan for the Middle East. He convinced the Arab league to accept an unprecedented agreement to recognize Israel if Israel would return land that were captured in 1967. Report that hasn't happened but that plan is considered still the basis of what <MIGHT> eventually be a peace settlement, or a big part of it. <OBVIOUSLY>, he was also very, very anti-Iran. Saudi Arabia sort of led that Arab part of the anti-Iran coalition and he has, that has been a real hallmark of Saudi policy over the last 20 odd years or more. And you <KNOW> that Saudi Arabia was not at all pleased with the Obama administration's attempt to sort of have a nuclear deal with Iran or any <KIND OF> agreements like that. Saudi Arabia also disagreed very strongly with the United States over policy towards Syria, Saudi Arabia wanted a Syrian moderate Sunni rebels against Bashar al-Assad to be armed and that caused a huge amount of friction with the United States. And interestingly, Saudi Arabia also refused to take its seat in the security council. It was made to have the Arab seat in the security council and it considered that an ineffective position and didn't take it. So it's a very close ally of the United States but very prickly too.\"}\n",

You <KNOW> what, sometimes -- well, you know, this time of year you'd expect to see sea ice, right, in many areas across northeastern China. The thing is that this time <AROUND> we're talking about some of the thickest in <QUITE> a long time. Let's go ahead and look at the pictures first of all, and then I'll show you which part of the world we're talking about. So this is an (inaudible) in Lazhou Bay in eastern China, just near Shandong Province. And just off the water here you can see how thick the ice actually is. Well, this is a problem, particularly for shipping because <OF COURSE> both cannot get in and out of the harbor. There are hundreds of boats that are literally stuck in that very thick ice and some of those boats can be permanently damaged because of the ice. Now one of the questions that comes up -- there you see the boats stuck in the ice -- that comes up often is also fishing. What happens with the fishing industry? Well, there's a lot of areas there for fishing that -- where they have fish farms, for example. Well, most of the farmers had actually finished their harvest already this year. Usually they finish that by the end of December. So they don't <THINK> that those areas will be affected. But, you know, you can see it there, pretty significant. Come back over to the weather map. This is a very busy area across northeastern China. We're talking in that northwestern corner of the Yellow Sea, in the Bohai Sea. And right over here you can actually see it on this visible satellite image from NASA the extent of the thick ice, in some cases over 125 kilometers. This is not the thickest that they've ever measures, or the widest that they've ever measured. They actually had more ice back in 2010. So this is the second time in two years where we have something so significant. And you guys in Beijing and Seoul, you know what I'm talking about. But it has been so cold over the last couple of weeks. And that of course has helped create that sea ice that you see there. Minus 4 now in Tokyo. The situation in Japan is going to be more snowfall on the way for you after all the snow that you had over the weekend, also very strong winds expected here as another push of cold air continues to move across the northeastern portion of the continent. This is what it looks like on the satellite as you can see here. Another area I want to talk to you about is as we head farther to the south, this is Indonesia. Over the weekend reports coming out of this area, particularly near Jakarta, of some very heavy rain. Well, this rain I don't think it's really associated to Tropical Cyclone Iggy, that storm is way down here to the south nearing the coast of Australia. However, this time of year we are talking about the wettest time of the year here across this part of world, anywhere from Papua New Guinea, which we had landslides last week, back over toward Indonesia of course, and peninsular parts of Malaysia. So <DEFINITELY> something to monitor. The other thing is, of course, is our Tropical Cyclone Iggy right here off the coast of Australia. Even though high waves have been a concern and even some scattered showers, the center of the storm itself is expected to stay out at sea and not have a direct impact here on this western coast of Australia. I want to switch gears completely and give you a brief update on what's happening in Europe, because this is also another big story, a lot going on. The heavy snowfalls across eastern Europe finally coming to an end. You look at the snow banks, Kristie, in some cases several meters high here. The snow coming to an end, but that Arctic high pressure will spread that cold air all the way into western Europe -- London, even today you were struggling to get out of freezing. Paris, you <MIGHT> not even get out of freezing over the next couple of days. Back to you.\n",

As you say, this was 8.04 a.m., 10.30 a.m. -- sorry, 9.30 a.m. The military says that then they saw North Korean soldiers approaching the border, <CLEARLY> looking for that defector to try and stop him. They said they fired 20 warning shots in the direction of the soldiers and just about 40 minutes later, they did hear firing from the North Korean side, but that didn't land in South Korea. So even though there was no direct exchange of fire between North and South Korea and soldiers on the DMZ, the very <FACT> that there is firing taking place would concern many. <OBVIOUSLY>, there's concern for miscalculation a great concern here on the border. And it's something that we are seeing more of. Remember just last month, you saw that defector running across the DMZ, being fired upon by his former North Korean comrades, and being shot four times. He has survived. But we are seeing a significant increase in the number of soldiers trying to defect across the DMZ. This used to be a route that was a rare defection route.

It's important, because it's a resolution of a significant standoff.

And particularly significant in this case, because, <OF COURSE>, this is a committee chaired not by a Democrat, as the House committees are, but chaired by a Republican. Senator Burr, which had led to enormous criticism of the Republican chairman of that committee, from members of his own caucus, saying that somehow -- and some of the Trump supporters -- saying that somehow he was not a real Republican or is being disloyal here, standing his ground, the committee standing its ground here. And now Donald Trump Jr. agreeing to sit down to be questioned. Of course, the question going forward is, what is the line of inquiry here? Are they concerned that he was not truthful before the committee when he appeared weeks ago? Is it possible they want to test his statements to see if he committed perjury then? Of course, the other question is, what more do they want to learn about what was a central part of the Russia investigation? And that is that Trump Tower meeting in June 2016, where he was interested and the campaign was interested in receiving foreign help, dirt on Hillary Clinton, from Russia. Yes, the special counsel concluded that there was no conspiracy between the two sides but it did cite a number of instances, like this one, to speak to contacts and interests and, as the special counsel said, you'll remember in that report, that there was interest from the Trump campaign in receiving that help.

Now, the most significant thing is, what are the questions that he has agreed to talk about? And is he going to plead the Fifth in relation to potential questions about whether or not he perjured himself before the committee in the past? Now, sort of the Trump team's favorite legal term these days is a perjury trap, a perjury trap. This is absolutely not a perjury trap.

There are seven million people here, densely populated. But you can see in recent days the chart is now darting back up. And just today, within the last hour, they've announced dozens more cases.

They don't know where these people are catching the virus. And when I spoke with these infectious disease experts, they said there is one reason why this is happening and it is the lifting of social distancing and people getting comfortable. People going to bars, taking off their masks, sipping a drink, and then talking, standing close together. Same thing at dinner when they're sitting across the table. This is why bars are now closed, along with movie theaters. I mentioned Hong Kong Disney closing, schools closing. You know, the list goes on of the social distancing restrictive measures now, actually, the toughest that they've ever been here in Hong Kong, effective today. This is day one.

So in this manifesto, this gunman really goes point by point, answering some of his own questions about why he's committing this attack. Now, he says he's a 28-year-old native of Australia.

And also interestingly, I <GUESS>, he said that he used guns in this attack to stir discord right here in the United States by really creating further conflict over the second amendment.

And in particular, he says he remembered the terror attack in Stockholm, Sweden. That was where a truck was driven into crowds that killed five people.

Now, the Navy divers they question the kids but they say this is what they've heard over several days. That would indicate that there are air holes close by within the vicinity of where these boys are seeking refuge, deep within the boughs of this cave.

But the soldiers who were in the hangar or at the dining hall with the president were told, if they wanted, they could enter a lottery, and they would have Thanksgiving dinner with the chief U.S. administrator in Iraq ambassador Paul Bremer. So they said, what the heck, let's do it. And then the next thing you <KNOW>, the president of the United States pops out from behind the curtain. There was explosive euphoric reaction here. These soldiers, men and women, are extraordinarily homesick, so any familiar face from home would have been welcome. And of course, the president's their commander-in-chief all the more so. I spoke with more than a few soldiers about all of this, and they said they were especially touched because he came to show how he really felt of us, about us. Another soldier said that it was very important for the president to come and share the hazards of the war zone with these soldiers. Still, off the record, over soldiers with whom I spoke -- that is, not for attribution -- other soldiers with whom I spoke still had their <DOUBTS> about being here. One soldier, even after the president was here, and he spoke highly of the president's visit, went on to say, all I care about now is getting out of here alive. Another soldier, praising the president also said he <THINKS> the troops have been here too long. He thinks they <SHOULD> go home. And another soldier, again, all praising the president's courage and his commitment to being here, this other soldier said the danger now is worse than it was several months ago when he came. Again, very important statement made by the president. He made a commitment. It was a bold and intrepid visit by the president.

Markets are also slipping in Italy and South Korea, where the outbreak is surging. Italy reports more than 220 cases. South Korea has almost 900, mostly in the southeast. And Iran is emerging as the epicenter of a Middle Eastern outbreak. The country has confirmed at least 61 infected and 12 deaths.

That particular hospital has since had a number of cases as well and a number of deaths related to it. So this is really what police and health officials are looking at at this point. We know that President Moon Jae-in is in Daegu himself, in this city, where there are some 2.5 million residents. I was down there a couple of days ago and there certainly were not many people on the streets. They were taking a lot of precautions. But they are pointing out that they are not locking down the city. They're going to put quarantines in place. They are going to try to contain the spread of the infections in that particular area. But it <DEFINITELY> is the southeast that is the hot spot, if you like, at this point. But there are still cases in Seoul. There are still cases in pretty much every province of this country.

There's the economy of white-collar, highly educated work-from-home families for whom they have recovered most if not all of the jobs lost earlier this year as a result of the pandemic. And then there's the economy of the working class, which is the people whom Trump is supposed to represent, whom he champions. He came into office. He won the election in 2016 on a narrative that Washington elites were ignoring the struggles of the working class. And meanwhile, you still have very high unemployment. You still have a lot of temporary layoffs converting into permanent layoffs at this point. You still have lots of small businesses, which <OBVIOUSLY> sustained many of those jobs, never reopening.

But as you pointed out, the timing is not a coincidence. We can show the hearing room right now which is the beginning of a two-day affair here where we are going to hear questions asked, and, yes, as Phil Mudd says, Director Coats is throwing a big bucket of cold water on any anticipation about him dishing about talking with the president.

So first on Wray, look, the other thing to remember is why did the White House settle on him, and Phil makes this point, other people told him no, right?

This is my attitude when a politician says, oh, I was just driving through Iowa and I'd just <THOUGHT> I'd stop and meet the local Democrats. It is not a thing, right?

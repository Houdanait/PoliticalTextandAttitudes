One room was disorderly with clothes crumpled, lying on the floor; also brand- new clothes still in their packets. They said there was a rudimentary kitchen where there was some running water. And then as the troops were searching right <AROUND> that building, somebody noticed some soil that didn't look right on the ground, a rug that didn't look right on the floor.

The anti-harassment training wasn't even passed down into the armed forces until three months after my son's death. If that training had started six years ago, <PERHAPS> my son would be alive today; perhaps the climate of violence and harassment wouldn't exist that's in the military today.\n",
      "Graded Statement Skipped 292:  And then there's the generals. When Vice President Pence calls for those who've carried out the atrocities against the Rohingya to be held accountable, he's talking about the military. But they're still very powerful back home. And Suu Kyi can't stop them, can't discipline them even if she wanted to. And that's a big if. And all of this means the Rohingya, Steve, have no good options and <PROBABLY> won't for a very long time.\n",

What are we to make of all of this? I mean, we are looming towards five hundred days in office for the President and not many less than that for Mueller's investigation. We've got midterms coming up in November. Just walk us through where we are at, at this point.\n",

It was a British intelligence source who said to me that this place is a big concern now and no joke, because you have all of the -- it <MAY> become a welcoming ground for any extremism that wants to get involved, that the Houthis, you know, just based on what they're about. As long as they're in control, they don't care who is there, as long as it's disruptive. And what <COULD> that mean?

So, they look at it in the same way. This is not, I <MUST> say, an issue that comes up a lot on the campaign trail. Again, as John explained, it doesn't have the power it used to have in <SORT OF> getting people to say, listen, you <KNOW>, the Democrats are all about gay issues.

      "Graded Statement Skipped 301:  Ana, we <DEFINITELY> are hearing some tough words from the regime of the president of Bashar al-Assad and also it's Russian and Iranian backers essentially saying if the U.S. pulls something like this again, there will be real consequences. Now, this was always the argument that the Obama administration had given for not intervening more forcefully or militarily inside Syria. That <PERHAPS> in doing so it <COULD> precipitate or escalate an actual clash between U.S. forces and Russian forces <POTENTIALLY> leading to some <KIND OF> a global conflict or a World War III. That would be a worst case scenario. But at this stage, we still don't really <KNOW> exactly what Trump's policy in Syria is going to look like. We have seen some glimpses of it today hearing from U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley who said Assad is definitely one of our priorities in the sense that he <SHOULD> go. Hearing frankly different message from secretary state Tillerson that our priority fundamentally is the fight against ISIS. And <OF COURSE> the concern from some is that it's difficult to engage in that fight against ISIS without some fundamental level of cooperation with the Russians. A very complex situation in Syria. A lot of very nuanced issues to be taken into account.

If so, that attention to detail <COULD> help you later in life. Take managing your money, for example. Writing checks is a part of everyday life and requires careful record keeping. If you don't keep good records, you could bounce a check, and that means big penalty fees from your bank. Bouncing a check means you wrote a check to someone without having the money in your account to back it up -- not a good way to make friends.

He grabbed a few things and left in his truck, filming from the front and back cameras. He let his office <KNOW> he wouldn't be in that night.

This is 192, it's a lot more. Canada was onboard to begin with, but I did visit Canada in -- I <THINK> it was in 2006, and met Rosa Ambrose, I think she was the environment secretary. She didn't last 12 months. But she told me <QUITE> <CLEARLY> that the -- this government, the Harper government, were not going to observe Kyoto. So, what they did, instead of meeting the 7 percent goal, which other countries were doing, they burst ahead, got a 17 percent plus, and took no notice, and intended anyway to leave Kyoto. And for them to talk about, now, \"I <BELIEVE> in the new agreement,\" can you trust a government that couldn't even actually achieve what it was supposed to do under Kyoto one, now promising to do something by 2015?

      "Graded Statement Skipped 313:  We're all praying for the president, praying for the First Lady and any of other folks that <MAY> end up testing positive as well but it is also true that the president in many ways with his behavior and his rhetoric opened the door to the White House to this virus and remember the White House is both a place of business, it's a workplace and it's also a residence, right? So if you <THINK> about those people who come to work every day, they were left very vulnerable because it was a president who didn't really like the look of masks. He <THOUGHT> mask were essentially ugly and didn't want folks <AROUND> him wearing them and so that is the <KIND OF> environment that was created. And listen, a virus is always looking for host and so this is what ends up happening. Again thoughts and prayers go out to everyone who <MIGHT> end up being affected by this and the folks who already are. But the president <OBVIOUSLY> did himself no favors, he did his family members no favors and the people who work around him.

      "            \"You're watching CNN. This is CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson. Welcome back, it's just half past seven here in the UAE. They call it the forgotten war but not for those living the bloodshed every single day. And it is important that you know about it. I'm talking about the conflict in Yemen, where today the Saudi-led coalition carried out several air strikes in what is the Houthi controlled capital of Sanaa. Now Saudi state-run news says forces hit a number of what it calls legitimate military targets. That's after Houthi militia claimed responsibility for the drone attack that targeted two oil pumping stations in Saudi Arabia. It's messy times. Early I spoke to Martin Griffiths who's the U.N. Special Counsel Envoy for Yemen to the Security Council and I got his take on how he sees the situation on the ground right now.\",\n",
      "            \"I think what is going on is the war that we all need to spend more time trying to resolve. And today and yesterday and the day before have been really serious reminders of that. I've always worried a lot and yesterday in the remarks I made to the Security Council in New York about the fact that events like this, apart from the tragic consequences for families, the worry that we have is that this could reduce the impact of these hard-fought gains we're seeing in Hodeidah. Of course, I'm very alarmed. It makes me more resolved to move more quickly, as fast as the parties allow, to a political solution.\",\n",
      "            \"Hodeidah, the center of gravity of course in Yemen's civil war. Preventing an all-out battle for the city has been a huge success to date. But on the question of who will assume security for the port going forward, there has been no agreement. There's a huge trust deficit between the Hadi government and the Houthis. What is your message at this point?\",\n",
      "            \"I think, first of all, that let's welcome what has been happening in terms of those redeployments in the last few days, step one. Step two, let's move as quickly as possible to agree the operational plans under general Michael Lollesgaard for the rest of the redeployments, so in fact the whole city can be demilitarized as was originally agreed all those months ago in Sweden. The local security forces, Becky, as you rightly point out, is a vexed issue. And I think the problem lies in part at least in the fact that the Hodeidah agreement as I know very well first-hand, didn't attempt to resolve the extraordinarily difficult issues of sovereignty in Yemen. Those issues will be resolved in a political solution. The Hodeidah agreement is a stopgap, the humanitarian stopgap, intended to improve the chances of the people of Yemen being able to survive the war. This has come down to a tug of war if you like over who's running the local security forces. The United Nations' role in this is by having the monitors and agencies on the ground to try to make sure that the security forces in both ports and city operate in a professional manner and maintain the security that is their mandate. So we will be there alongside them. I understand why many people in the government of Yemen say but we need to have these forces handed back to us. Well, that wasn't agreed in Sweden. I wish it had been. I hope it will be resolved when we get a political solution. It's my job to try and get an approach to this particular issue which doesn't create an impediment to the demilitarization that I referred to.\",\n",
      "            \"Has the West simplified what is going on in Yemen, to Yemen's detriment?\",\n",
      "            \"I am sure that those who say that the Yemen war is a proxy war are simplifying the events in Yemen. Yemen is a Yemeni war and indeed there have been many wars in the recent years as you know in Yemen and we're still fighting them. The primary interest for someone like me is to resolve the Yemeni issue so there can be a return to politics in Yemen. Of course there are interests from the region and elsewhere, the is a shipping lane to Europe, but those interests are understandable but the primary focus of any peace process is Yemeni, not proxies. It's about Yemen.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. The U.N. Special Envoy for Yemen to the Security Council, he knows his stuff, Martin Griffiths. Let's get more from our own senior international correspondent, my colleague, Sam Kylie joining me live here in the studio. You were in Yemen just a couple of weeks ago, you spent some time on the ground. You have a series of excellent reports coming out this week or next week. You heard what Martin Griffiths said, does that echo what you've heard on the ground, Sam?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. It does, very strongly I have to say, Becky. I mean we've concentrated our work in the Houthi area and then Al Bayda. My colleague has done some excellent work in the government and Saudi backed coalition areas. In both cases, yes, there are interested parties particularly in the south and the pro government forces are dominated by Saudi air, a lot of UAE troops and Sudanese and so on, on the ground. In the Houthi areas, it really was not evident the presence of the Iranians. Nor do the Houthis particularly care to deny that they did get help from the Iranians. What they insisted upon was that they sought help wherever they could get it, the help was relatively small. We've seen some of the evidence in some of the missiles that the Iranians have helped improve. Some of the seaborne IEDs have been actually manufactured parts of them in Iran. But that the Houthis were very fiercely independent of the Iranians and everybody else. That's kind of what they're all about, trying to create this what they would describe as a pure version and uncorrupt vision as they would put it for the future of Yemen. So I think Mr. Griffiths is actually dead on when he says the whole talk of proxy, particularly right now in America, is somewhat exaggerated when it comes to the Houthis.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. The Yemen war, another issue that \\\"IREPORT\\\" puts the UAE's ministry of state and foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, who I spoke to very late last night, I asked him how he saw the efforts to end the bloodshed there. Let's have a listen.\",\n",
      "            \"Right now, we have a very hopeful sign in Yemen, imperfect I have to admit, difficult I have to admit. But again we have a sign with the Stockholm agreement. We have for example now the pull out on Hodeidah. But here the onus in on the UN to ensure that this pull-out is genuine, that there will be no snapback by the Houthis. I think it is in our common interest to morph from a military phase of the confrontation to a political phase. Now it doesn't help when the Houthis right after agreeing to deal with the UN after four months of procrastinating to try and target civilian installations inside Saudi Arabia. So clearly there is very little trust in what the Houthis have done. How can you on one day attempt peace your way and only four days later augment options of war?\",\n",
      "            \"There is increasing international pressure to stop the U.S. and Europe's arms sales to the coalition. Trump has vetoed the U.S. bill in the Senate to that effect. Are you worried that you will lose all international support for the campaign in Yemen? And how are you preparing for that?\",\n",
      "            \"I think the campaign in Yemen is basically on the cusp of a different phase right now. And I think if you really look, the coalition in the last two years has been the biggest supporter for a political process. It is not us who has held back Stockholm for five months. It does concern us and bother us of course when the issue in Yemen is not totally understood and only one dimension of it is highlighted.\",\n",
      "            \"This has been a long, bloody, grinding war for years. It's too easy to blame the coalition when we know and we've seen evidence of what the Houthis do on the ground. You know, it's also too easy to blame that side when we understand this is an asymmetric war. The campaign is on the cusp of a different phase, says Anwar Gargash. I genuinely believe he believes that and hopes a political solution is nigh. Is it?\",\n",
      "            \"I think it's urgent, certainly from the evidence we saw on the ground they are on the brink of a cholera epidemic. We visited a cholera clinic in Hadja, which is basically a fairly middle-class looking town up in the mountains. It's a beautiful scenic place. There were children there and adult grown men facing cholera. There are pockets of extreme hunger but the word famine has actually been dropped completely from the lexicon. I spoke with some non-U.N. NGOs who said there are pockets of very extreme shortages of food but broadly across that area there is food. What there isn't is money. And the whole effort at the moment is focused and this is where there may be hope as Mr. Gargash is indicating there for a political breakthrough, because there is beginning to be an agreement and that's why Hodeidah is so important, between the two sides to agree to allow the distribution of government salaries both sides of the front line based on the 2014 payroll. Now if they can start getting money into the system, then they can actually see where the real cracks are. At the moment it's a humanitarian problem that could be solved fairly rapidly. That could usher in a political solution.\",\n",
      "            \"A series of excellent reports as I suggested from Sam. I know you would applaud the team that you work with on ground in Yemen, those reports out next week starting I hope on Sunday, thank you, sir.\",\n",

The last e-mail the family received from his captors before James Foley was killed said, in part, \\\"We will not stop until we quench our thirst for your blood.\\\" It punctuated a series of communications between the two sides where the family appealed for mercy, and Foley's captors never seemed interested in that.\",\n",

The militants at one point demanded more than $130 million for his release, according to the president of Global Post the news agency Foley worked for. Until last week, Foley's family had heard nothing for almost a year. Then an e-mail arrived, saying, \\\"He will be executed as a direct result of your transgressions towards us.\\\" Foley's parents had sent multiple messages to his captors, hoping to engage them. According to the president of Global Post, the family appealed to the captors to show mercy, saying James Foley was an innocent journalist and showed great empathy for the Syrian people. He says the family told the captors they had no control over the actions of the U.S. government. One expert says the family was right to engage the captors.\",\n",

Any organization or agency that could help. And they were certainly very aware of the case. I had conversations with the White House as recently as yesterday. They are doing everything possible to make sure that Steven is returned to his wonderful parents. They're lovely people.

So this is a very grieving situation for them. I can't fathom how difficult it would be for them to be facing this terrible ordeal with not knowing and Steven's life in the hands of these murderers, barbarians. But we will pray, and as one of the family members said, there's a petition in Change.org. And they ask for people to sign the petition and to continue praying for Steven's life.

In fact, they used chemical weapons twice, and still we did not do what we said we would do. So it was a mistake for us not to act then. Many of us were supportive of the president's actions. And then, when it comes to ISIS or ISIL in Iraq, what we have are natural allies, the Kurds. They're fighters. They want to defeat this horrible terrorist regime, and they will do so if we give them the arms to fight. And so I support limited air strikes, and furthermore, I support arming the Kurds so that they can take ISIL out. We cannot let this cancer grow.\",\n",

A second eyewitness said he also saw Thomas Jones, but it appeared that there was some sort of a cloth, a dark cloth in his hand. Again, he, too, could not vouch there was a gun. Police have not found the weapon they say was used to shoot an officer in the hand. Now where the video was taken, that was the the second location. We spoke to one man, and he said he saw Jones behind the wheel of a car about two blocks before it came to a dead stop. He said it appeared that Jones had slumped over to the left. He said it appeared that Jones had passed out. All of these, of course, questions we're going to be asking the police commissioner and the mayor when they hold a 6:00 press conference. We do want to say that a source close to the mayor says they're very unhappy about the way the police department is being portrayed here in Philadelphia. They say back in the '80s a major effort was under taken in order to improve relations with police and the communities they serve, and sort of get away from the tough policing that marked the Franc Rizzo (ph) era. Now the mayor and the police commissioner did meet up together today. I asked the commissioner when kicking is considered part of procedure, and he said, well, it's not something that's taught in the academy, but police make the determination when they're in a life-and- death situation. Reporting live from Philadelphia, Deborah Feyerick. Back to you, Judy.\",\n",
      "            \"Thank you, Deborah. And joining us now from Philadelphia with more on this story, including potential political fallout, Tom Ginsberg of \\\"The Philadelphia Inquirer\\\" and Jill Porter of \\\"The Philadelphia Daily News.\\\" Jill Porter, to you first. Are there enough facts in yet on this case to be able to make a determination whether the police were at all justified in what they did?\",\n",
      "            \"I don't think there are, I think that if you look at the video, you can see that the police are surrounding the suspect. You can't see him. You can't see whether he's subdued. There are reports that indicate he was biting a police officer at time and wouldn't let go of his thumb. And that's why I think that the police commissioner and the mayor have handled this quite well in saying, let's wait. We only see this videotape. And it's obviously very inflammatory, but let's see. Let's get all the facts before we make some conclusion about how the police acted, although I do agree that kicking in and of itself seems so barbaric that it's very difficult to find a way to rationalize that. But you have police officers who are in very high state of emotion and not necessarily going by the book.\",\n",
      "            \"Tom Ginsberg, how is the city reacting to this so far?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, the city seems to be riven really. The black community is enraged, and to a certain point people are taking very strong stands on both sides. As far as the convention goes, everyone has expressed anything from sadness to remorse that this is -- seems, they say, to be tarnishing the image just a few weeks before the convention.\",\n",
      "            \"And same question to you about how the city's reacting to this, Jill Porter. Is the city just split in half along -- or split along racial lines here?\",\n",
      "            \"No, I have to say that I don't perceive it that way. I think that there's a certain certain number of people in the black community who feel as Jerry Mondesire, the head of the NAACP, that this rises to be a racial incident. Otherwise, I assume they wouldn't be filing the suit. But I think that there's a certain amount of calm. I think that there is a respect for the police commissioner. There were African- American police officers involved as well as white police officers, so I think that there's a split as to whether or not it's perceived to be a racial incident. So...\",\n",
      "            \"I was going to, if you don't mind, interrupt here and get back to Tom. Tom Ginsberg, what is the sense about the convention? You've been talking to people, Republicans planning this convention. Are they concerned that this could disrupt anything they're trying to do?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, quite the contrary. The Republicans are putting out a concern but confident face, and I guess that's the way to phrase it. George Bush made -- George W. Bush made a comment about it yesterday, as did President Clinton, giving a very measured response, saying we have to wait for all the facts and expressing he's aware of it. But the Republicans are really pointedly not talking about it, and don't seem to be thinking it will become an issue for them. It's different, however, when you talk about what's going to go on on the street. There are lots of protests that are planned, and from what I can gauge by talking to various organizers, this incident will, you know, at least energize them if not bring more people into Philadelphia. The idea that it would scare people away, I'm not finding that.\",\n",
      "            \"Jill Porter, what kind of protests are being planned?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, there -- all of the people who were in Seattle and just every organization that you can think of are coming. And there are lots of planning, both on the part of the police and on the part of the protesters. And I think that -- clearly, I think that the potential for this happening during the convention is really going to be minimized by this. I think the police have been in a lot of training, they know what to anticipate, and that's a very different situation than happened down on the street corner this week.\",\n",
      "            \"Tom Ginsberg, is there something, is there anything that Governor Bush could say at this point? You did say that he's commented yesterday, but is there anything else he could say or the Republican Party could say to smooth the situation at all?\",\n",
      "            \"I don't -- I don't see that that's the way things are going. It seems to be attention is focused on the mayor and the police commissioner and the police department itself, and I think that the protesters who are planning to come here, who were already planning to make a statement about police brutality, what they called police brutality and opposition to death penalty, and other things, they will just carry these further. And I think it's a good point that Jill made that, in fact, their goal is actually to take the issue to the Republicans and not even necessarily to the police. So you may not -- we're talking apples and oranges as far as confrontations, in a way.\",\n",

Some of your fellow Republican candidates did, as well, Mr. Buck in Colorado, Sharron Angle in Nevada. They also lost, like you did.

Are journalists pumping up Gore's spat with Joe Lieberman or covering a real split in the Democratic Party? And is Dick Cheney just ducking the question or being harassed over Halliburton? Welcome to RELIABLE SOURCES, where we turn a critical lens on the media. I'm Howard Kurtz. We begin with the child kidnapping stories that have consumed the airwaves this summer. The media descended this week on those two California teenagers who survived a terrifying abduction, and the big winner was Katie Couric who landed an exclusive interview on the \\\"Today\\\" Show.\",\n",

Is this case, engaging in a stampede to get the interview, even when the subject are two young women who are raped and threatened with death by a drunken gunman? \\\"Los Angeles Times\\\" columnist Steve Lopez certainly thinks so, and he joins us now from the paper's newsroom. Steve, you write \\\"What parent would allow a child who had just been the victim of such a harrowing nightmare at the hands of so despicable a man to talk about it on television a mere 24 hours later? The beauty of the deal for television, which so defines our culture, is that there is no accountability for such exploitation.\\\" Now everyone in TV wanted to interview these teenagers. Was there something in particular that bothered you about the sit-down with Katie Couric?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, not that one in particular. I think just the whole spectacle, and it wasn't just the girls. It was that, you know, just this endless drone, this every tragedy that is immediately, instantly trivialized on television. Less than 24 hours after this incident occurred, one of the girls appeared on local television, and I was sort of -- I had the TV on in the background, and was not even sure that it could possibly have been one of those girls, because I didn't think that anybody in their right mind would push her in front of a camera. But it was the beginning of an entire weekend of news about this. You had the sheriff telling the nation that they had been raped, and then on Monday morning, you had, you know, Matt and Katie with the interview - Katie actually. And I just - I thought to myself, you know what, if I had a teenaged daughter, the last place that I would want her to begin to deal with this kind of an attack would be in front of a camera.\",\n",
      "            \"But of course, in the case of these teenaged daughters, they had been held at gunpoint, but nobody forced them at gunpoint to do these interviews. Why shouldn't it be their choice?\",\n",

But I think that's part of the sickness of this thing, just this - you know we - the way in which we need to sort of validate our lives by being on television. It's as if, you know, that was where everybody went for you know to share this experience and to find comfort, and that was part of what was so disturbing about this, that the parents didn't stop and say to themselves, you know what, this was a violent attack. Rape is a violent attack. The abduction, that they were bound, they were held against their will. They were witness to a hail of gunfire that killed their abductor, and I just - I was just shocked that in this culture people would within just a few hours after that kind of experience, push their daughters out in front of the cameras like this. I just think it's the last place to deal with that kind of - that kind of invasion.\",\n",

I think that - I think that they were just looking for any justification, to feel a little bit better about having made this decision that came under some criticism.

A lot of the response was supportive, but I also got - I also got barbecued by quite a few readers ...\",\n",

      "            \"... women who - well what they said primarily was that these girls have nothing to be ashamed of and because you've been raped you should not just be shunned by society, pushed off into a corner and survive out your years in the shadows, and I responded to many of them saying no, you missed the point. Of course, they shouldn't be ashamed by what happened, and of course, it's a good idea to talk about these things. But you talk to your family. You talk to your mother, your father, maybe a trained counselor. You talk to a smaller community of friends and supporters ...\",\n",

Another producer from another network is reported to have cried to one of the girls that she'd lose her job if she didn't land the interview. What does this tell us about the say that television booking works?\",\n",
      "            \"Well this is another aspect of the story that's so disturbing. You know, to those people who criticized me for saying that these girls ought to talk about this, it's a form of empowerment and therapy. I can only say that television cheapens women at every turn, at every opportunity. It sells lurid TV shows, titillating lowest common denominator kinds of television shows and it sometimes hard now to tell the difference between a sitcom and the evening news. And the idea that television is the place that, you know, a victim of a sexual assault might be comforted is just ludicrous.\",\n",

      "            \"Well, I think that television just exploits in general, and I don't think that's it's particular to women or men. It just exploits and it unfortunately trivializes tragedy because it's just a blur at this point.\",\n",

We turn now to Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, once again under the media microscope, but this time they're duking it out over why they lost in 2000 leaving journalists to sort through the mess. Lieberman talked about the flap on \\\"Fox News Sunday\\\".\",\n",

      "            \"So is the press overplaying the incident? Are the media just looking for any excuse to write negative stories about Al Gore? Joining us now to talk about that and other recent fixations of the political Press Corp, Josh Marshall, who has his own Web site, \\\"Talking Points\\\"; Byron York, White House correspondent for \\\"National Review\\\"; and Dana Milbank, White House reporter for \\\"The Washington Post\\\". Dana Milbank, Al Gore says he relied too much on consultants in 2000 and the press accuses him of reinventing himself. He skips the Democratic Leadership Committee meeting and he gets bad press. Friday's \\\"New York Times\\\", Al Gore would have to overcome deep resentment over his 2000 campaign to get the nomination in '04. Sounds like there's deep resentment among the press corp towards Mr. Gore.\",\n",
      "            \"Al Gore has a big problem. The problem is one day he's going to say something that he believes to his corps and it's going to be completely honest and we're going to say, oh, that big phony, he just thought that up last night. And Joe Lieberman has the opposite situation. He could be full of baloney, but everybody's going to take him to be sort of the honest guy, saying it as it is. So when the two of them fight together, you just know what side the press is going to be on.\",\n",

      "            \"Well a couple of things. One, the media coverage is just reflecting a real antipathy toward Gore on the part of a lot of Democrats. A lot of Democrats feel he, you know, messed up, being given a big lead by Clinton.\",\n",

      "            \"You think he's getting soft treatment?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, in his editorial - let me tell you, in his editorial in \\\"The New York Times\\\", he took lots of really whiny shots at George W. Bush, talked about the Harken and Halliburton mess, referred to bad apples in the White House, and the press decided to concentrate on this Al versus Joe thing. They used to be comrades in arms; now they're against each other. And they actually -- I think they could go harder on him for his incredible whining.\",\n",
      "            \"You know what it is, Howie, I -- and I think that Gore is sanctimonious and that's sort of the worst thing you can be in the eyes of the press. And he has been disliked all along and it was because he gives a sense that he's better than us - he's better than everybody, for that matter, but the sense that he's better than us as reporters. Whereas President Bush probably is sure that he's better than us -- he's probably right, but he does not convey that sense. He does not seem to be dripping with contempt when he looks at us, and I think that has something to do with the coverage.\",\n",
      "            \"So this seems to suggest, Josh Marshall, that if a candidate or office holder or president, you know, develops a good rapport with the journalist types who cover him, then that's going to be reflected in the coverage, and if a candidate seems aloof, as Gore often did in 2000, then he's going to pay for it in the coverage.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, I think there's no question about that, and I certainly wouldn't agree with all of what Dana just said, but that's certainly the dominant press impression and to a certain extent it doesn't even matter if it's correct or incorrect. It's just a reality and Gore was up against that in 2000, and he'll be up against it in 2004, if he runs again.\",\n",
      "            \"But incidentally, these stories are not really concentrating on the fact that Gore is way, way ahead in the polls of any other Democratic challenger. I mean ...\",\n",
      "            \"... and you have to remember, he did win the popular vote in the year 2000 and ...\",\n",

      "            \"And the - and the subtext of all of this coverage is that he's a terrible loser, and that, you know, in some sense that's completely counter to reality.\",\n",
      "            \"Now turning to Joe Lieberman, he has always in my view gotten great press; when he became the first Jewish candidate to run for vice president, when he was the first Democratic senator to denounce Bill Clinton over his love life. Until now, suddenly he criticizes the theme that he ran on with Gore, people versus the powerful, and your old magazine, \\\"The Republic\\\" says Lieberman's total lack of charisma and unrepentant shilling of behalf of corporate interest. So why is Lieberman getting slapped around?\",\n",
      "            \"I think that's a bit of an anomaly, and I think - I think Lieberman, as I was saying, has this notion of being a truth teller. He's going to speak truth to power. He's going to say it as it is, even if it's not in his interest. It's sort of the McCain phenomenon. Now he can be blatantly pandering, but he'll still have that reputation and that's still going to come through. So reporters like Lieberman for that reason and they probably always will.\",\n",

      "            \"And they're going to jump all over ...\",\n",
      "            \"And this is why I think he actually can't, and I think in the final analysis that's why he actually won't even run because Joe Lieberman's whole, you know, kind of claim to fame is integrity, and he's a truth teller and stuff like that. And if someone like that is going to run for president, you can't kick off your campaign by breaking your word.\",\n",
      "            \"So you're saying the press in a way holds Lieberman to a different standard because lots of politicians have gone back on the no-running pledge, including Bill Clinton who told the voters of Arkansas he wouldn't run ...\",\n",

      "            \"Well, at the moment we're all populous, because business is in trouble and this will pass and then suddenly everybody's going to be back to taking as much corporate money as they can.

      "            \"\\\"Up front this morning, alcohol in the cockpit. The arrest of two America West pilots who were charged with trying to fly a jetliner while drunk draws attention to a growing problem in the industry. According to \\\"The Wall Street Journal\\\" this morning, the FAA says nine pilots have violated alcohol abuse rules so far this year. That is twice the rate of previous years. Here with a personal perspective is a former Northwest pilot, Lyle Prouse. Twelve years ago he was arrested for flying while intoxicated and spent time in a federal prison for that offense. He joins us now from Atlanta to share some of his experience with us this morning. Good morning. Delighted to have you with us this morning. Welcome.\",\n",
      "            \"Good morning, Paula.\",\n",
      "            \"If you could, Lyle, take us back to the day of your arrest in 1990. What happened?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I had been drinking the afternoon and evening before a flight. And you know, I went over to this place. I didn't intend to stay. I didn't intend to drink a lot. I didn't intend to get drunk. But the fact of the matter is I drank way too much, and I was arrested the following morning when I landed -- and I should have been.\",\n",
      "            \"When you got into the cockpit that day before you flew from Fargo to Minneapolis, did you know how much trouble you were in?\",\n",
      "            \"No, I didn't. And you know, I didn't, I had no idea that I had a problem with alcohol. You know, I came out of an alcoholic family. I had struggled very hard to be different from the two parents that I had grown up with, both of whom were alcoholics and died from the disease. And I didn't think I had a problem. But that's the very nature of the disease of alcoholism.\",\n",
      "            \"So what you're saying, then, is your arrest was the first time you had to confront the reality that you were an alcoholic?\",\n",
      "            \"That's true. And you know, the very nature of impairment is that when I'm doing something after I've been drinking, I don't recognize the fact that I am, in fact, impaired. And I didn't think I was that morning. And that was flawed thinking. You know, it's -- it doesn't gel with what I know now, but that was the way it was that particular morning.\",\n",
      "            \"Do you ever remember going to the cockpit feeling like you weren't in complete control?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I had been hungover before. It wasn't a widespread common occurrence in my life, especially when I was working. But yes, there were times when I flew and I didn't feel like I was 100 percent. There were times when I didn't sleep well that I didn't feel 100 percent. So you know, I'm not sure exactly how to answer that question. It wasn't like it was an everyday occurrence.\",\n",
      "            \"During your trial, the prosecutor made the point that he thought you may have flown that morning to protect your career over the lives of the passengers you were flying that day. Did he have a point?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, it was a female prosecutor. But no, she didn't. It was not a conscious choice that I was going to risk the lives of 58 people in order to save my career. Had I thought that I was endangering anyone at that time, I would not have flown. You know, I said to somebody at the time, you know, if I had thought we were going to crash, I wouldn't have gone. I was in the front of the airplane. I hit first. But that's the nature of being impaired. I didn't understand then what I do understand now. And you know, this is an insidious process. And I want to make clear that I'm not implying that these two gentlemen are alcoholics. I have no way of knowing that. That will be determined medically. And -- but I know that I am, and I didn't know it until that morning.\",\n",
      "            \"And based on what you know today, how much regret do you have that you even got into the cockpit that day and the day you flew from Fargo to Minneapolis, where you were later arrested?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I'm going to give you a mixed answer on that. Do I regret that I risked the lives of 58 people? Absolutely. I certainly do. But I'll tell you this: As I look back on it, it was the thing that saved my life. So, you know, I have mixed regrets. I would like to find every one of the 58 people that were on board my airplane that morning and apologize to them and talk to them. That's not possible. I can't do it. But the horror and the tragedy that I experienced that commenced and began that morning, which launched me on another journey, was the very thing that saved my life. And do I regret that? No. It took a long time for me to find any kind of gratitude, because we were broke inside the first month that this occurred. My life was destroyed and shredded and devastated. And I didn't know at that time that I was beginning to build a new life. It didn't feel like it that particular morning. I have no idea what's in store for these two gentlemen. But my hope for them is that they will find something even remotely close to what I have found.\",\n",
      "            \"And what you found is new peace in your life?\",\n",
      "            \"I've been sober since that day, you know, in a story that's too long to go into here and that's filled with miracles, I was never to fly again, ever to fly again. I had been stripped of everything. And it was fair. I should have been stripped of everything. I accept full and total and complete responsibility for all of that. But I was subsequently able, over a journey that was a million miles and a million tiny steps, all of which were connected to each other, to regain my licenses. The president of my airline, in a courageous moment that I will never understand, and the corporation itself demonstrated extraordinary courage, and they brought me back. I was able to retire as a 747 captain. I never could have dreamt that.\",\n",
      "            \"You must have an enormous amount of gratitude that you were given that second chance?\",\n",
      "            \"I have gratitude every single day. I live under a big umbrella of gratitude. I don't have any bad days today, you know? I am grateful to be sober. I am grateful for the things that happened to me, because without them, the other things could not have happened for me. The prison experience was a grim, horrendous, sick, obscene experience, but it was part, it was simply part, of the price I had to pay. And I accepted that.\",\n",
      "            \"And Lyle, I know you feel that when people hear about stories like the arrest of these two pilots yesterday, they often jump to conclusions, and the conclusions are much exaggerated. But what can you tell the American public this morning, some flyers who are very shaken by this news that don't have complete confidence in the men and the women who are at the controls of the cockpit?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, it's a mistaken concept. You know, this is a horrible tragedy, as was mine. But the airlines have a tremendous monitoring program. We have tremendous alcohol programs. We have tremendous peer identification programs. But you've got to understand and recognize that no system is ever perfect. There is no profession anywhere that I am aware of that is as closely regulated, monitored, and watched as that of being an airline pilot. We have to do things on a routine, annual basis that doctors don't have to do, attorneys don't have to do. And it's a safe environment. These things happen, and it's sad, and it's tragic, but we live in a world where human beings do certain things, and I'm sad to see this thing. And I have a flood of emotion, you know, as I -- and I have great empathy for the passengers. I'm not purely, totally pro- pilot. But I know, I know what it's like to go through something like this and to have your entire life defined by the worst moment in it.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, we've just got about 10 seconds left. In closing, I know you take full responsibility for what happened to you, but what role ultimately do you think flight attendants and copilots need to take for -- what kind of role do they need to play in each other's lives?\",\n",
      "            \"I think one of the most difficult things that anyone will ever confront is talking to someone else, a close friend or an employee and an associate about their drinking. It's just a horribly hard, difficult thing to do. And it requires great concern and a high level of courage to do that. But that's the only way that we're going to be able to help our fellow employees, and that is to call up the courage that's required to do that.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, we thank you for sharing some of your courage with us this morning. We know it's not easy for you to travel back in time and discuss that very painful chapter of your life. But we're happy to hear you're on a brand new, happier road. Lyle Prouse.\",\n",

The question is, what should be routine, of course, is no more. Returning students and staff are met by more police officers and counselors than there were before. For some today, it was their first chance really to talk about what happened with their friends and with their teachers. Kyung Lah joins me now with more. It had to have been an extraordinarily difficult day for these students?\",\n",

And we spoke to parents and students who were returning, and what we were hearing from them, Anderson, is that parents say they're eager to get back to the routine. They know that kids like routine. If you're a parent, you know that's what your kids want. The students say when they were on the bus it was extraordinarily quiet. They were starting to have those quiet conversations inside the school. An 11-year-old boy told us he actually felt better being in school. He felt protected there. His teacher was reaching out to them. Those counseling sessions were happening inside the school. As a sign of comfort, it was across Newtown and in the surrounding communities, police cars at every single school. At the high school I was at here in Newtown, three police cars, and the students say they made them feel better.\",\n",

It's been particularly difficult for -- obviously, for students to go back to school. Dr. David Schonfeld is a crisis counselor who gave a presentation to teachers in Newtown about how to talk to children at this incredibly difficult time.

      "            \"Well, I also wanted them to know that we had to change some of the expectations of what we could accomplish in terms of learning over the next week. I told the teachers that really we have to meet the students where they are right now. And we also have to meet the teachers and the other school staff where they are. And so I told them that as far as I was concerned there was really only one lesson plan that they needed to teach before they broke for the New Year's. And that was to make sure that the children knew they were safe, and that they cared about them, and they were going to care for them.\",\n",
      "            \"And I guess for a number of these students, this is obviously the first time they've had to face death. That they've had to deal with this at all.\",\n",

Unfortunately, we know that about 9 out of 10 children are going to experience a significant loss of a death of a family member or friend by the time they complete high school. So for many children, it will not be a new experience, but obviously, this is a profound experience for anyone.\",\n",
      "            \"And how do you -- I mean, do you talk to kids? Or I guess part of the lesson is that not all teachers will be counselors. That if somebody needs your extensive conversation, there are other people to refer them to?\",\n",
      "            \"I think it's important that we underscore that what we're asking the teaching staff to do, and the rest of the staff and the school, the support staff, is to create a supportive environment. Not to provide counseling. It doesn't need to be -- it's not their responsibility to provide therapy. There are others in the school that will do that. And others in the community that have that role. But what we want from the school staff is to be -- is to be able to create a safe and supportive environment.\",\n",

And actually the American Federation of Teachers reached out to me on Friday and asked me to come and help their staff, and then I arrived here on Saturday. And I was greeted immediately, you know, by the commissioner of education, Stephen Pryor. And we met well into the night about what to do. And then when I came and actually was able to meet with the superintendent, Janet Robinson, and the other staff, I was really impressed by the concern, the caring, and the profound commitment that they have for these children.\",\n",

      "        \"utt\": [\n",
      "            \"During the ongoing state of affairs in Iraq, the nuclear stalemate with North Korea often gets overlooked. To bring you up to date, a first round of six-way talks on the stalemate took place in August, and the north has said it's willing to attend another round. The discussions are aimed at persuading North Korea to halt its nuclear program. The north is believed to have one, probably two nuclear weapons already. Joining us now, the authors of a new book on the conflict. The book is called \\\"Nuclear North Korea: A Debate on Engagement Strategies,\\\" published by Columbia University Press. The author is here in Washington, Victor Cha. He's a consultant to the Pentagon. David Kang, he's of Dartmouth College. Victor and David, thanks very much. Congratulations on the new book. Victor, I'll begin with you. What's the best way for the United States government to convince the North Korean government to forget about nuclear weapons?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I think the best way is to get every country in the region, Japan, China, South Korea, Russia, the United States all together to tell the North Koreans, you can't have nuclear weapons. You can security, you can get aid, you can get a lot of other things, but you can't continue down this nuclear path. Gong for nuclear weapons will make you less secure, not more secure.\",\n",
      "            \"Is that a realistic option, David?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, it's a realistic option as long as the United States addresses the security concerns of North Korea. Asking North Korea to give up the weapons on the hopes that they can trust the United States is not going to work. And I think that's been shown over the last couple of years.\",\n",
      "            \"Didn't President Bush recently go a little bit further in trying to address those security concerns, Victor, by suggesting that the U.S. would put in writing some of those concerns?\",\n",
      "            \"I think he did. The president at the APEC leader's meeting in Asia said that the United States, in conjunction with the other countries in the region, would be interested in providing some sort of peace assurance to the north. I mean, this in many ways is calling the north's bluff. They say this is what they want, to give up their nuclear weapons. And now we'll see if they're serious.\",\n",
      "            \"Why should anyone believe Kim Jong-Il? He's a tyrant, he's a murderer, he's a dictator. People in North Korea are starving to death. It's a brutal regime. Why would anyone trust this guy?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, the key point is that they don't trust us any more than we trust them. And part of the kind of negotiation that's going on right now is aimed at trying to see what the North Koreans really want, as Victor said, calling their bluff, but also being able to provide something in return.\",\n",
      "            \"Is there a military option, a realistic, David, military option? Some hawks are suggesting, you know what, there is no way you can deal rationally with a guy like Kim Jong-Il. You've got to just deal military with him.\",\n",
      "            \"Every president comes in attempting to take a fairly hard line, realized that the costs of going to war are extremely high, and that's a risk that most U.S. presidents have not gone down that path. So people are not really that concerned that...\",\n",
      "            \"So is it because they're a nuclear power, even though they haven't tested formally a nuclear bomb, does mean that there really is no military option?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I mean, I think it means there is no military option. But what's interesting about the point that you just made is that it's not the nuclear capabilities that deter us from considering a military conflict on the Korean Peninsula, it's North Korea's conventional capability. They have thousands of artillery tubes deployed ready to strike on Seoul and Tokyo. So it's this conventional threat that acts as a deterrent to hostility. And if that's the case, North Korea is secure. They are secure from a threat from the United States, as they say. And therefore, one then questions why they need nuclear weapons.\",\n",
      "            \"The message though that is sent to tyrants around the world, David -- correct me if I'm wrong -- if you're a leader in Iran or anyplace else that's one of these so-called rogue nations, the evil empire, the axis of evil, as the president has called them, is you better hurry and develop a nuclear bomb if you want to deter the United States from actually doing to you what it did to Saddam Hussein.\",\n",
      "            \"That's one thing that I would emphasize. That in terms of the economic reforms that North Korea has been taking, it hasn't been only a purely recalcitrant regime. They've been making attempts to try and open up their economy. And in that sense, I think we should encourage those moves rather than just retard them.\",\n",
      "            \"Is that a realistic option?\",\n",
      "            \"I don't really know. I mean, I think in many ways this reform effort that the North Koreans are under taking is a black hole because they need to reform. They're a very close society. But as we see, history has shown the process of reform for these close societies ends up being the end of the dictatorships. And that's the reform dilemma that North Korea faces.\",\n",
      "            \"I've been along the DMZ, David, the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, where about 30,000 or 40,000 U.S. troops normally not that far away on the southern part. Obviously one of the most dangerous spots on Earth. But now there is word that Defense Secretary Rumsfeld wants to move those troops away from there, get them out of harm's way, if you will, whereas for 50 years they were seen as a trip wire.\",\n",
      "            \"And in fact, that concerns both the North and the South Koreans, because it's not clear what the U.S. would do then if its troops are out of harm's way.\",\n",
      "            \"Is that smart to get those troops away from the DMZ?\",\n",
      "            \"I think it's smart. I mean, I think in the long term it's smart for the U.S.-South Korean alliance, because South Korea is a different country from 1953. You know, the end of the Korean War. It's a democracy; it's got an educated youth. It's an OECD country. It's the 11th largest economy in the world. You can't have large foreign military bases in huge metropolises like that. They're crises just waiting to happen. So in the long term, I think this is actually...\",\n",
      "            \"But if the U.S. completely pulled out of South Korea, that would send shock waves I think in much of that part of the world.\",\n",
      "            \"I agree with Victor that, over time, the U.S.-Korea alliance has to be modified. I'm not so sure that we should be doing it right now while this other crisis is going on.\",\n",
      "            \"But one final word on Jim Jong-Il. And we've studied him, we've analyzed him. There is this notion he likes to drink Hennessey (ph) cognac and that he likes porno films. What's the truth about this guy? Is he a nut or is he someone who is rational that you can deal with?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, there is no denying he has these material pursuits of his that have to do with all sorts of strange things. But at the same time, I think our analysis has found that he is a very rational person, he's a rational leader. But just because he's rational doesn't mean that he's not dangerous. He's still very dangerous.\",\n",
      "            \"David, you get the last word.\",\n",
      "            \"Absolutely, I agree. He has -- like most dictators, he has a very interesting lifestyle. But does he know the kinds of decisions he's making? Yes.\",\n",

The zoo's director is standing by the decision to shoot the silverback after a little boy entered its habitat.

Hi, there, Jessica. The outrage sort of flows both ways, doesn't it?\",\n",

The hashtag #JusticeForHarambe trending on Twitter, don't take your kids to the zoo if you are unable to keep an eye on them at all times, one user writes. Some are questioning how the protective barriers around the enclosure were breached. That's now under review by zoo officials. Officials who claim the rails and wires the boy crawled through meet all safety requirements and have been in use for 38 years without incident.\",\n",

Now as for the zoo itself, it's saying that they hope to reopen that gorilla exhibit by this weekend, of course that's pending all of the assessment of those protective barriers -- Robyn.\",\n",
      "            \"Thank you so much, appreciate it. Now the debate and the finger-pointing goes on. In a new opinion piece, CNN commentator and legal analyst, Mel Robbins, says the blame game should end. Well, Mel joins us now via Skype from Boston. You talk about a little empathy but the responses to your opinion piece online tell us quite a lot about the judgment that's being thrown around with this story.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, Robyn. Everybody is suddenly an expert in silverback gorillas and knows exactly what should have been done now that they can look backwards at it. I have to admit that one of the reasons I wrote the piece, Robyn, as a mother of three is because I found myself as I was reading the headlines over the weekend immediately jumping to the conclusion that the parents must somehow be idiots or they must have --\",\n",
      "            \"-- done something. And I was envisioning -- remember that famous scene of Michael Jackson, dangling his child over the balcony? I was envisioning that that's what happened. But now that we know that this is an instance where the child, as far as the facts are being reported right now, climbed over this barrier and got into the exhibit and was determined do it, I just -- I don't see how you can blame the parents for being momentarily distracted at a busy zoo. I just don't.\",\n",
      "            \"And you're speaking as a mother but also as a lawyer. Do you think this is going to go further? I mean, is anybody, can anybody be charged here? Whether it's the zoo or the parents or, hey, even the crowd, who seemed to be also agitating the gorilla?\",\n",
      "            \"You know, I think that this is one of these tragic situations, where it was just one horrible accident that created a unfortunate situation for the zoo. And you asked about charges, could there be criminal charges? Not unless the facts are somehow tremendously different. If the parents had dropped the child into the enclosure, you could of course seek criminal charges. If there was something so recklessly negligent about the barrier, you could see criminal charges. But none of the facts bear that out. Could there be a civil case? Well, there may be; however, the only negligence would be around the barrier itself. And at the moment, when you hear that the barrier's been in place for 38 years, that this child just darted away from his mother, that there were dozens of other adults, Robyn. And nobody's talking about this. This happened so quickly that none of the other dozen people standing around actually saw the child go over the barrier. People -- that's how fast it happened. And so I think that there's no negligence here on the part of the zoo. Unless we find out something was in horrible disarray with the barrier and unless we find out that this mother was off talking on her phone for several minutes, I don't think there's any negligence on the parents' part at all. And it's a horrible tragedy. I don't think the zoo had any other choice but to shoot the gorilla.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, and I think many people know -- and I think that -- many people know how fast a 3-year old who wants to run can run. And but that said, these armchair critics or people who are second guessing the parents, this is a sort of an unfortunate clash of animal rights activists, children rights activists and all, of course, stoked by cellphone video, social media. This is sort of a perfect storm in many ways, isn't it?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, it absolutely is. And I think that it's really easy to sit in the comfort of your home and second guess what happened, based on cellphone video that you're looking at leisurely over the weekend. And this is a situation that's stokes everybody's emotions. I mean, think about the zoo. Think about those officials. Of course they didn't want to shoot this animal that was basically a family member to many of the people that cared for it. Of course they didn't want anything to happen to this child. But just pause for one second and think about the alternative. Let's say they tried to lure the gorilla away with fruit and they stalled another five minutes. Let's say they tried tranquilizing it first, but when they shot the gorilla, assuming they hit it, that the gorilla got agitated and crushed that kid in front of all those spectators and killed him. There was no alternative here. And the people that lost out the most were the zoo. They didn't want this to happen. They didn't plan for it to happen. They -- you know, I mean, it just is so tragic for everybody involved and for people to be reacting with such vitriol to the family and to the child and to the mother and to the zoo itself, it's -- frankly, it's ridiculous and it's counterproductive.\",\n",

But amid growing jubilation, there is still fierce fighting under way right now in the streets of the capital, Tripoli, and the Libyan leader is nowhere to be found. The rebels captured three of Gadhafi's sons, but Libya's ambassador to the United States tells us that one has now escaped, saying he was -- quote -- \\\"hijacked\\\" by Gadhafi's forces. And just this weekend, a Libyan state television anchor pulled out a gun on the air and vowed to fight to the death for Moammar Gadhafi. Now she's been captured by rebels. State TV is off the air. We're watching all of these developments, lots of loose ends unfolding right now, a missing dictator, continuing heavy fighting. The U.S. says the Libyan regime is just about finished. Let's go to our White House correspondent Dan Lothian. He's covering the president's vacation in Martha's Vineyard right now. Dan, set the scene for us. The president came out and spoke today.\",\n",

Nonetheless, a White House aide says that the president's strategy over the last six months has yielded -- quote -- \\\"favorable results.\\\" With the toppling of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi seemingly hours or days away, President Obama all but declared the U.S.-NATO strategy a success.\",\n",

What does that say to you?\",\n",

And there's still a lot of work to do, not only militarily, but there will be a great task ahead is, building a democracy in a country that's never known it. And it's going to require a lot of work and a little luck.\",\n",

      "            \"I think we should be worried about a lot of things, but the fact is, Wolf, that you saw the rapid collapse of the Gadhafi forces. The only thing that was holding him in power was money and fear; and once those are dissipated by military strength, then it's very difficult for anyone to be loyal to Gadhafi, unless they are a blood relative. So I -- I worry about that. I worry about the different tribes. I worry about the piece that you just had on weapons of mass destruction. I worry about the prisons. I hope we can secure them soon, because there's hundreds, if not thousands, of political prisoners. I hope that we won't see a repeat of what happened in Baghdad: looting of public buildings. I -- I'm -- I think that there's a number of other -- especially, and I appreciate the National Transition Council's message on reconciliation and national unity. There's a lot of bad blood there, and let's hope that the people will restrain themselves and recognize that a bloodbath is not in anyone's interest.\",\n",

In six months they've eliminated a 42-year reign of terror.\\\" How much credit does he deserve for this strategy that he put together?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I think the president deserves credit for stopping Gadhafi when he was at the gates of Benghazi and had vowed to go house to house to kill anyone when opposed him. But the fact is, if we had used the full weight of American air power, it would have been gone -- over a long time ago, and the fact is that young Libyans were wounded and were killed because of that, quote, \\\"leading from behind.\\\" That's -- I am pleased at the outcome. I'm sure the president will take a lot of credit for it, but the facts on the ground are that it could have been over a lot earlier than it was. And now let's move forward, try to work together, Republicans and Democrats, without spending federal dollars, because it's not money that they need, in working to help Libya make this transition to Democrat -- democracy and a beacon of freedom.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, explain why you believe the U.S. air power would have been more successful than the French and the British, the other NATO air power, because they've launched thousands of sorties, as you well know, over these past several months.\",\n",
      "            \"Wolf, I've seen the sortie count before. I saw it in the Vietnam War. The AC-130, the A-10 and other capabilities that our allies do not have, could have been put into -- into action, and we could have taken out Gadhafi's forces earlier. That's just a military reality. Our allies are wonderful people. Eight nations out of the 28 in NATO were involved in it. Especially helpful were Qatar and UAE. They deserve great credit. But there's no country in the world that has the unique air power, as well as other power, but particularly air power we could have deployed by deploying U.S. air power into the fight. And it's just fact.\",\n",
      "            \"But there -- no American lives have been lost over these six months. That's a significant fact, as well, right?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, and no allied lives have been lost that I know of. Because this is unique terrain, unique advantage to air power, when you have long stretches that the enemy has to go over unprotected, and the -- and it's -- it's ideal for the use of air power and has been since World War II -- the conflict in World War II. So air power is the key and dominant factor, and our allies, as wonderful as they were, didn't have the capabilities that we have. By the way, we did supply Predator, and we gave them some additional information. We did help in some way, but not with a full weight of U.S. air power, which is unique in the world. Look, that's over with. I want to work with the administration and with the TNC and these brave people to move forward, and now meet the challenges, which will be incredibly difficult, but achievable, of building democracy.\",\n",
      "            \"Two years ago you actually met with Gadhafi at his ranch. You got to know him a little bit. I -- there's a tweet that's now been widely distributed that you put out at that time, in which you said, \\\"Late evening with Colonel Gadhafi at his ranch in Libya. Interesting meeting with an interesting man.\\\" What were your impressions of him? Specifically, will he give up now, or will he fight to the death?\",\n",
      "            \"I don't know, because there's different -- you can't read somebody after -- know somebody after a brief meeting. I think that, if I had to guess -- and it's a pure guess because I don't know him -- that he would probably fight to the death, but I don't know that for sure. I do know that he has American blood on his hands because of Pan Am Flight 103. I know he is responsible for other acts of terror in the region, and I think that people who worry about what comes after Gadhafi, I think we would be well served if we make sure that there is not an extremist takeover or hijacking of this revolution, and the ones that I met of the transition council are very fine people.\",\n",
      "            \"One final question, Senator, before I let you go. What do you say to those Republicans, including some Republican presidential candidates like Michele Bachmann or Ron Paul, who say the U.S. has no business getting involved in these countries? They have plenty to do here. Just stay away from countries like Libya. What do you say to these Republicans?\",\n",
      "            \"I say that the United States of America is a unique experiment in history. I believe in American exceptionalism. I wasn't for sending ground forces into Libya. It would have been counterproductive, but we are an inspiration to these people. I know because I've looked them in the eyes, and they looked at me. They look to America for inspiration and leadership. And when they're struggling for freedom under brutal and oppressive dictatorships, if we can help them -- and it's a big \\\"if\\\" from time to time -- then we should go to their assistance and make ourselves and our children and our grandchildren and their children and grandchildren proud.\",\n",

Within the classroom, you can mitigate that risk, particularly if you have the older kids wearing masks, desks at least 1.5 meters apart and good ventilation. All those things can be achieved.

Of, course the majority of those coming from the country of Brazil, which is getting closer and closer to reporting 3 million cases just on its own. Consider how we got to this point. It was back on July 7th that the region reported its 3 millionth case. It was 15 days later that the region reported its 4 millionth case and now 13 days later on August 4th, the region reported it's 5 millionth case of this virus. It's not just what the coronavirus is doing on its own. It is also the collateral damage that this pandemic is having on other services. For example, the World Health Organization is concerned about that. The Pan American Health Organization director said, at a briefing on Tuesday, quote, \\\"More than a quarter of countries have suspended routine vaccination campaigns and weeks or months of disruption will increase the risk of outbreaks and vaccine-preventable disease, reversing our long-standing trends in the region.\\\" And then consider school children. Tens of millions of school children across the region are having education disrupted. Here in Mexico, the government just announced that the more than 30 million students in this country will not be going back inside the classroom anytime soon. Instead, they will begin remote learning, starting on August 24th. The reasoning is simple. The government says the pandemic in this country is still just too bad for it to be safe for school children to begin in-person learning again. Remember, Mexico is a relatively poor country. So for children who don't have good Internet connection at home, the government is actually partnering with several different television stations that will begin broadcasting classes, educational content, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. That way kids can still learn at home, even if they don't have a great Internet connection -- Matt Rivers, CNN, Mexico City.\",\n",

President Trump firing the DHS secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, and the director of the Secret Service. We're told more heads are likely to roll, as Mr. Trump is said to be -- quote -- \\\"unhinged\\\" about border security. Tonight, sources tell CNN the president has been pushing to reinstate and expand the widely criticized family separation policy. Also breaking, prosecutors say they're still investigating whether a Chinese women accused of illegal entry at the Mar-a-Lago resort was actually trying to spy. At a hearing in Florida, they warned she lies to everyone she encounters. This hour, I will talk to the House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs Committee member David Cicilline. And our correspondents and analysts, they are also standing by. First, let's go to our CNN chief White House correspondent, Jim Acosta. Jim, we're learning more about the tensions that led up to the firing of the Secret Service director and the homeland security secretary.\",\n",
      "            \"That's right, Wolf. President Trump is shaking up the Department of Homeland Security. A full-scale purge, as you said, is under way, as the president has essentially fired the homeland security secretary and the Secret Service director in the last 24 hours, and there are more departures expected soon. And a familiar face, White House immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller, is working behind the scenes to clean house, we're told. But a Trump adviser said much of the blame for the chaos at DHS and across this administration right now lies with the president. As this adviser put it, the president still has not learned -- quote -- \\\"how to govern.\\\"\",\n",
      "            \"In one of the biggest shakeups of his administration, President Trump is cleaning house over at the Department of Homeland Security. The latest official to go, Secret Service Director Randolph Alles, who follows the forced departure of DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and the sudden withdraw of the nomination of Ron Vitiello over at ICE. Top officials at Citizenship and Immigration Services and the DHS general counsel could be next. The Secret Service director told agency employees that he wasn't being fired, but had been warned weeks ago that transitions in leadership were coming to DHS. Nielsen, whose exit was tweeted by the president Sunday, insists she still supports Mr. Trump.\",\n",
      "            \"I share the president's goal of securing the border. I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the border. And other than that, I'm on my way to keep doing what I can for the next few days. So thank you all for being here.\",\n",
      "            \"Before she was forced out, Nielsen was clashing with the president over the influx of migrants at the border, as Mr. Trump told asylum seekers they're no longer welcome in the\",\n",
      "            \"The system is full. Can't take you anymore. Whether it's asylum, whether it's anything you want, it's illegal immigration, can't take you anymore. We can't take you. Our country is full, our area is full, the sector is full. Can't take anymore. Sorry.\",\n",
      "            \"Sources tell CNN the president wanted to resurrect the family separation policy at the border as a deterrent, despite Mr. Trump signing an executive order last year ending the practice of tearing children from their parents.\",\n",
      "            \"We're going to have strong, very strong borders, but we're going to keep the families together. I didn't like the sight or the feeling of families being separated.\",\n",
      "            \"CNN has also learned that top domestic policy adviser Stephen Miller, an immigration hard-liner, has been acting as the president's ringleader behind the scenes, directing top DHS officials to adopt harsh tactics on the border. A Trump campaign adviser said much of the blame belongs to the president, adding -- quote -- \\\"Trump will never find border success until he learns how to govern. The border situation is his failing and his alone. The fact that Trump listens to Stephen Miller on this issue is why it will never get resolved.\\\" Part of the problem, the adviser said, is that the president doesn't understand government policies. Just last Friday, the president got his facts wrong about a key part of immigration law known as the Flores Settlement, saying it was named after a judge. But it was really named after a young migrant.\",\n",
      "            \"We have had some very bad court decisions. The Flores decision is a disaster, I have to tell you. Judge Flores, whoever you may be, that decision is a disaster for our country.\",\n",
      "            \"The president has tapped the top official at Customs and Border Protection, Kevin McAleenan, to take over at DHS as acting secretary. That means the Trump administration is run by yet another acting official. The president has also blindsided the Secret Service, which is dedicated to protecting the commander in chief, even though he has repeatedly praised the agency in the past.\",\n",
      "            \"I could not be happier with Secret Service. Secret Service has done a fantastic job from day one. I'm very happy with them.\",\n",
      "            \"Now, a Trump campaign adviser said the president has talked about resuming family separations at the border as a way to gain leverage with Democrats in the immigration debate. And senior registration officials also CNN the president has asked about closing ports down on the border, only to have top officials inside the administration warn him that that kind of policy would backfire as a P.R. nightmare. He's also instructed Border Patrol agents to turn people away, echoing what he said last Friday when he said, our country is full, even in cases when some of these migrants, Wolf, are asking for asylum. And when I talked to a Trump campaign adviser earlier today who was questioning whether or not the president knows what he's doing when he's cracking down on the border and shaking up his administration and his immigration team, this adviser put it this way, Wolf. This adviser said, this is not a Kirstjen Nielsen issue. This is not a Jeff Sessions issue. This is a lack of understanding issue -- Wolf.\",\n",
      "            \"Jim Acosta at the White House, thank you very much. As the Secret Service director is being shown the door, there are growing concerns right now about security at the president's resort. Tonight, new details have emerged about a Chinese woman arrested at Mar-a-Lago and her suspicious stash of cash and electronic devices. CNN's Kaylee Hartung is joining us from West Palm Beach down in Florida. Kaylee, authorities, they're still looking into the possibility this woman was attempting to spy.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, Wolf, the word espionage is nowhere to be found in the criminal complaint or affidavit filed by the U.S. attorney here against Yujing Zhang. Among the exhibits entered in court today, passport images, two passports she brought to this country, one valid, one expired, but with that expired passport, a valid visa was attached. In court today, our first look at Zhang. We saw a woman timid and awkward who is facing two federal crimes. And authorities shared why they have more reason to question her motives and intentions here.\",\n",
      "            \"New details emerging tonight in the case of Chinese national Yujing Zhang, who allegedly gained unauthorized access to Mar-a-Lago, before getting arrested by Secret Service agents. Prosecutors revealing that investigators are probing whether she's a Chinese spy who was trying to infiltrate the president's resort after uncovering a trove of electronic devices in her possession. Found in Zhang's hotel room at the upscale Colony Hotel in Palm Beach, one cell phone, one signal detector, nine USB drives, five SIM cards and several credit cards in her name, as well as $7,500 in $100 bills, a total of more than $8,000 in cash, including Chinese currency. This in addition to what Zhang was caught with when she was arrested at Mar-a-Lago after staff realized her stories didn't match up, four cell phones, a laptop, a hard drive, and a thumb drive containing malware. A Secret Service agent taking the stand, saying the malware on the thumb drive began installing itself on an agent's computer when he initiated a preliminary examination. Prosecutors say that Zhang has repeatedly lied to investigators. When Zhang arrived at Mar-a-Lago, she told a Secret Service agent she was there to go to the pool, but prosecutors say she arrived in a long gray dress without a bathing suit. A Mar-a-Lago staff member recognized she had the same last name as a member of the club and believed her to be a relative, so she was granted entry. The defense noting Zhang is one of three names in China that 275 million people have. Her story then changed when press by Mar-a-Lago staff, showing them this flyer on her cell phone for an event she said she was there to attend, the flyer presented in court today the same as an invitation posted on the business Web site of Cindy Yang, the Florida spa owner who was allegedly selling access to Trump events at Mar-a-Lago. Zhang's attorneys say she wired $20,000 to someone she believed to be organizing the event in order to come to the United States and visit Mar-a-Lago. But, according to the defense, the event was canceled without her knowledge. Zhang is charged with two federal crimes, making false statements to federal authorities and a misdemeanor offense of entering a restricted area without authorization. Her attorneys fighting hard to dispute the trespassing charge, saying the only thing Ms. Zhang did was give a very common Chinese name to gain access to Mar-a-Lago. The State Department has revoked her visa, a federal prosecutor outlining their case as to why Zhang is a flight risk, saying she lies to everyone she encounters and has absolutely zero ties to the United States.\",\n",
      "            \"This was a pretrial detention hearing, but, Wolf, no determination was made on that matter, as the defense asked for a one- week extension, saying they have had some communications with people related to Zhang in China that could be of help for her, as the judge decides if she will be permanently held in detention awaiting trial. And, Wolf, the federal prosecutor says by that date next Monday, he expects to return an indictment as well. There will be a lot of ground to cover next Monday here.\",\n",
      "            \"We're watching it closely with you, Kaylee. Thank you very much. Joining us now, Congressman David Cicilline. He's a Democrat. He serves on the Judiciary and Foreign Affairs Committees. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us.\",\n",
      "            \"My pleasure.\",\n",
      "            \"I want to start with Jake Tapper's reporting today. He has learned that President Trump tried to actually shut down the border crossing at El Paso, Texas. He tried to get border agents to reject migrants. He's pushing for an expanded family separation policy, among other steps. Can he do these things legally?\",\n",
      "            \"No, Wolf, he cannot. This is very disturbing reporting, that the president is actually telling agents that they should violate the law and disregard applicable asylum applications and shut down the border. And this is a Department of Homeland Security and a president really in chaos, who's trying to suggest that the rule of law doesn't apply, and that he can unilaterally decide to change the laws in this country. That is not the case. He's not a king. He's the president. If there are going to be changes in the immigration laws, it must come through Congress. And the notion that the president of the United States would be encouraging agents of the United States to violate the law and disregard congressional statutes is very, very alarming.\",\n",
      "            \"It comes as the president is carrying out what one official is describing -- and I'm quoting now -- as a near systematic purge over at the Department of Homeland Security. Is the president looking for people who will simply say yes to these policy proposals?\",\n",
      "            \"It certainly seems that way. I mean, the notion that the president is removing people because they refuse to violate the law and implement the policy that he's articulated is very disturbing. This is -- again, remember, Secretary Nielsen was the individual who implemented the child separation policy, who lied about it publicly and defended the president's position. And, apparently, she's not a tough enough, according to the president. So one can only imagine what he's looking for. This is apparently being led by Stephen Miller, who is a well-established kind of anti- immigrant hard-liner. And so we have to look very carefully at the people they're going to put into these positions and be sure that they're committed to following the rule of law, following the statutes as they currently exist, and not individuals who are prepared to violate the law at the president's direction.\",\n",
      "            \"Just moments ago, Congressman, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction against the president's remain-in-Mexico policy, as it's called, for some asylum seekers here in the United States. Is this part of a pattern?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, I think there's no question. Look, the president seems frustrated. I mean, he's failed in his policies at the border. And so he thinks that somehow he can just stop people from coming, end asylum applications and build a wall. We have laws in this country. We're a country of laws, not of men, as they say. And so there are asylum laws which exist. People have a right to petition for asylum. They have a right to have a hearing and for a determination based on that. You cannot keep people out of the country who have a lawful basis to seek asylum. And so the president's trying to circumvent the law. We are a country of laws. And I'm not surprised a court has told him that he cannot do that.\",\n",
      "            \"One of the people fired by President Trump is the head of the Secret Service. You just heard those details about the Chinese woman who made her way into Mar-a-Lago, the president's resort town in Palm Beach, Florida. How much of a threat does a breach like this potentially pose?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, it's significant. I mean, this president is a national security risk, it seems. He doesn't take seriously the security measures that are in place. Don't forget, this is someone who shared classified information with the Russians about ongoing operations while meeting with them in the Oval Office. He was at a public meeting with President Xi at Mar-a-Lago. And he uses an unsecure phone. And there has been reporting that intelligence is picking that up, the Chinese and the Russian intelligence agencies. So this seems like a president who doesn't understand the dangers of these kinds of breaches, and to have a Chinese national with no explanation with a thumb drive on the grounds of Mar-a-Lago, who lied about why she's there, and we still don't know all the circumstances, but this is very alarming. This is where the president is with the key leaders in his administration. And we should all be concerned about that kind of a breach.\",\n",
      "            \"On a different subject, Congressman, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee -- and you are a member of that committee -- is calling on Chairman Nadler to bring in Robert Mueller to testify as soon as possible. Nadler says you need the Mueller report first. Why are Republicans do, you believe, making this push now?\",\n",
      "            \"It's unclear to me. I think the Republicans should be joining us in demanding the release of the Mueller report. We continue to wait for it. The committee chair is now authorized to issue a subpoena. But I think the chairman is right. We need to have the report in our hands, review its contents, so that we can ask Mr. Barr about some of the decisions he's made and then, of course, as Mr. Mueller to kind of walk us through the report and his findings. So we expect the attorney general to produce the Mueller report in its entirety without redactions. And I think that is the position of all the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.\",\n",
      "            \"The attorney general, Bill Barr, as you know, will be testifying before the House Appropriations Committee tomorrow. What are you hoping to learn from him specifically on the issue of redactions to the Mueller report?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I'm hoping to learn from him what he intends to keep secret. He originally said he had to limit it to sources and methods to protect classified information and to protect grand jury testimony. He can, of course, ask the court to authorize the release of that to Congress fairly easily. But he's also added some other categories about embarrassing the reputation of third parties, peripheral third parties. I think we need to know from Mr. Barr on what grounds he intends to keep secret contents of the Mueller report and press hard for a full disclosure of that to Congress. We can certainly redact it and certainly prevent the public from seeing things that are not available to the public. But members of Congress ought to see the report in its entirety. We see classified information all the time. We can do it in a classified setting. I think the committee really is going to press him hard on, what is he redacted and under what authority is he keeping that secret from the Congress of the United States?\",\n",
      "            \"He says he also wants to redact information that could affect ongoing federal investigations, whether the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York or the U.S. attorney here in Washington. Is that appropriate.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, it may be appropriate to keep that from public dissemination. It's certainly not appropriate to keep it from Congress. We have the ability to see the report in its entirety, to keep confidential that which must remain confidential, in order that we can make decisions about how we proceed at this moment. That's quite a different standard. I mean, that's what happened in the Starr investigation. The full report and 17 boxes of documents were produced for the Judiciary Committee as soon as the report was done. That ought to happen here. That's the right precedent. This investigation began on behalf of the American people because our democracy was attacked. We have a right to know and the American people have a right to know what the facts are and that nobody is above the law and what actually happened.\",\n",
      "            \"The president's acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said Sunday that Democrats, in his word, will never -- repeat -- never get President Trump's tax returns. What do you make of that?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I think he should read Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code that makes it clear that the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee is entitled to demand production of the tax returns of any person in the United States. It's not a may. It's not if you want. It's shall produce. So, Mr. Mulvaney is wrong. That -- those tax returns will be produced for the committee. That is the law. And if we have to fight and go to court to make it happen, we will. But Mr. Mulvaney is dead wrong.\",\n",

In more recent times, Chinese have come to the table much more sophisticated, ready to negotiate, with greater flexibility and more authority.

But whether or not it's safe, working in those underground mines is a tough life, and arguably tougher than -- at least physically tougher than working in a grocery store. Now, why am I making that comparison? Because, according to a Web site that belongs to a lobby group for the coal industry, the accident -- this is -- I'm quoting -- \\\"the accident and injury rate for miners today is comparable to that of grocery store workers.\\\" So, I wanted to check that out with the Department of Labor. And here's the fact. In 2004, there were 71 grocery deaths and only 26 coal mining deaths. But there are a lot more grocery store workers in the United States than there are coal miners. Now, if you look at it in terms of per 100,000 workers in an industry, the mining industry as a whole is the second most deadly industry to work for in America. The most dangerous industry is a grouping which consists of agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting. And if you take all those together, they have 30 deaths per 100,000 workers in 2004, only two more than mining. So, this is definitely a dangerous environment. It's a dangerous field. And, a little later on, we are going to talk about whether or not unionized versus non-unionized mines make a difference to the safety of workers. Wolf.\",\n",

Coal fatalities, 1900 through 2004, just over almost -- it's -- I guess it's 104,000 right there. And, if you take a look by state right there, you can see, Kentucky had 130. West Virginia was just behind that, and, unfortunately, with the latest tragedy, West Virginia pulling ahead. This is from '93 through the current date. Now, we want to take a look at the map and the dangers of coal mining related to other types of mining, this for 2004. You can see the concentration right here of coal mining in the West Virginia- Kentucky area, 28 fatalities last year. The second to that would be stone mining, with only 13 fatalities . And the worst mining accident ever, take a look at this, in West Virginia, it was in 1907. It was an explosion, killed 362 people. Now, again, we want to point you to the new CNN Pipeline broadband service. This is commercial free.

They also feel that they have a greater ability to complain to inspectors of unsafe conditions, without reprisal. As I said, the union, with our health and safety committeemen, we stand behind all our members. A union member cannot be disciplined or discharged in any fashion for complaining about unsafe conditions. We take that very seriously.\",\n",

Federal regulators had grown alarmed by the heavy mortgage losses at Wachovia, and over the weekend, they had scoured the industry looking for a white knight. Wells Fargo had been among the banks that considered a deal only to say, no thanks, in the end. Then early this morning came word that Wells Fargo had changed its mind. What had happened? In a conference call today, Wells Fargo's Chairman Richard Kovacevich, said the company had simply needed more time to study Wachovia's books.\",\n",

In fact, Cox says, it may have to.\",\n",

In fact, allowing the deal to collapse would save the federal government a lot of money at a time when it's already absorbing many billions in new debt.

      "            \"DNA results can often be helpful. But, you know, I've been doing this a long time, and for most of the years I've been doing this we didn't have DNA. We had to deal with sexual assault cases the good old-fashioned way: witnesses got on the stand and told what happened to them. And the thing about DNA is not only it's -- that it can point the finger to who the guilty people are, but it can also tell us who the guilty people are not. And it's important to remember that there are 46 members of the Duke University lacrosse team who were asked to submit to giving samples for DNA testing, and only three of those people are alleged to have been involved in the assault. So, until we identify all three of those people, that means that some of these young men are going to be walking around under a cloud where innocent people are being thought that perhaps they're guilty just because of their association. And, you know, part of the job of being the district attorney is not just convicting the guilty. Part of the job is freeing the innocent. And we always need to be aware of the fact that being associated with a particular group does not acquaint to guilt. I have been criticized by both sides of this case. There have been people who said that I should have given this case up a long time ago, and there are people who said that I should have already indicted, moved to get somebody with some charges. The fact is that this case is proceeding the way a case should proceed. I am trying to determine exactly what the evidence is that we have to proceed on and to assemble that evidence before anyone is charged. But as I said earlier, I assure you by my presence here this case is not over. Thank you.\",\n",

Officials, including the district attorney there in Durham, talking about the latest development in this -- these allegations of rape on the Duke campus. Earlier yesterday, actually, defense attorneys for lacrosse players came out and said there were no DNA matches, but as we just heard the district attorney say, his investigation goes on. As he said, just because there was nothing left behind, doesn't mean that nothing happened. And he said in the majority of rape cases that is the situation. So he will continue to go on and continue to investigate, as he said, the old-fashioned, as they used to do before they had DNA results. These results are raising new questions, though, in the Duke rape case. And to get more on what's happening on the Duke campus, we want to welcome on the phone Seyward Darby. She is the editor of the Duke's campus newspaper, \\\"The Chronicle.\\\" Seyward, good to talk with you again.\",\n",

So we had to basically scrap everything that we had planned at that moment and went into overdrive, sending people out to talk to as many people on campus as we possibly could. And there are mixed reactions. A lot of students say that they're pretty relieved, that they kind of figured that this was going to be the outcome because they didn't think that the lacrosse players had done it. And, of course, no student wants to see any fellow student charged for such a heinous crime. So people said, you know, they were relieved to finally hear the tangible proof about the DNA. Other students are saying -- in agreement with what the district attorney has been saying, that this doesn't mean that this is the end of the case, that he has asserted that he has evidence that he's going to be forward with and that this is just a setback but that this will continue. Other students are saying they still have no idea whether they think the players are innocent or guilty and are just still kind of waiting it out to see what the district attorney is going to say next.\",\n",

Even yesterday, when we were asking people about the results from the DNA tests, some people said, you know, well, even if these tests are back and even there's a quick resolution legally to this entire situation, it's just opened different wounds in terms of racial issues, class issues, the relationship between Duke and Durham, and that these are broader issues that are have to be addressed over time. And that's something that the university has said it's taken note of. President Richard Brodhead has formed several committees to examine the culture not only of sports, but also just a personal responsibility and student life on campus. And, of course, students have mixed feelings about that, because a lot of people say, you know, how much can a committee or an initiative actually do, how tangible is that going to be? But I guess, you know, that will remain to be seen at this point.\",\n",

If we can reduce how much gasoline we consume, that will put an excess gasoline into the inventory, which means price gets lower because competition falls in. So, really, try to go only once to the store a week, try to go only once to the -- you know, to shopping. Really consolidate these things.

At that time, gas prices had soared about 19 cents in three weeks, with the average price for a gallon at $2.32. The highest average price in the nation one year ago was in Bakersfield, California, at $2.62 a gallon. Still lower than our current average. That hike was blamed on lingering high crude oil prices, growing demand and higher refining cost. Two weeks later, the Lundberg Survey found gas prices had declined by nearly 4.5 cents thanks to a drop in crude oil prices and slightly lower demand. By the end of April 2005, the average had fallen to $2.27 per gallon. Many motorists are likely hoping history repeats itself at the pumps.\",\n",

But now a Sunni tribal leader from that region has told CNN that the fight against ISIS in Anbar Province hasn't been going well for some time. Iraqi army with help of local Sunni tribes have been struggling to slow down ISIS but have not made much progress. But now a Sunni tribal leader from that region has told CNN that things are really desperate to the point where if those Sunni tribes were to withdraw their support from the Iraqi, he believes the Iraqi military would collapse very quickly. Now, those tribes are not about to do that. They are fighting for their survival as well but it's a damning assessment. This tribal leader believes the only way to change things is greater international support from the air and on the ground with weapons and perhaps even U.S. troops. Now, the Iraqi government doesn't want to see U.S. troops on the ground but it does want greater assistance in every sense -- airpower, weapons, intelligence, greater coordination, getting it to where it's needed faster. That's what the Iraqi prime minister says. We've seen something of a response, I think, from the international coalition. In the last 24 hours, around half of the reported successful air strikes carried out by coalition aircraft have been in the region of Anbar -- Carol.\",\n",

The main tribal groups are standing this fight out -- the United States has not reaching out to them. They're not talking to them. The only people that are doing any real fighting are the Shia militias which are backed by Iran. Sunnis call them death squads. So you're not really seeing a consensus in the Sunni areas of Iraq against ISIS. The policy is going to have to change. That's not a surprise to me that ISIS is gaining ground there. As for Egypt, the Egyptians are really facing existential threat in Libya. They can't even fly their helicopters close to the border because ISIS has surface-to-air missiles. So this bombardment is just the beginning of something. And you know, we in the United States have got to get serious about Libya because it is a threat to Europe. It's an easy boat ride to Italy. This is all pretty much a mess -- the whole thing. And I can't tell you where it's going right now.\",\n",
      "            \"So these air strikes -- let's talk about the air strikes that Egypt has conducted. I think they conducted two rounds just within the last several hours. The reason they're doing this, of course, is because ISIS killed 22 Egyptian Christians in the most gruesome way as you might imagine and we're not going to show any of the video or still pictures from that video because I just don't think it's necessary. So I guess my question is, in light of what you just said about Egypt's military hardware, do you think that these air strikes were remotely effective?\",\n",

But you know, Libya -- it's not even a failed state. It's just complete chaos there. You know -- will Egypt invade and occupy Libya? If it becomes bad enough they will. But I think the United States has got to step up and find an armed force there to back up the Egyptians. This is no longer about democracy, rule of law, it's an out and out war there which we have to show more leadership.\",\n",

If this spreads to the Gulf, we're in trouble. And that's what we should look about is the speed of this disease and come together with a plan. Like a Manhattan plan how to stop it.

But look what they're doing right now. And oh, my goodness, my Guinness, Diageo has stout sales in Africa. I'm Richard Quest, it's going to be a busy hour, because I mean business. Good evening, here in the U.K., unemployment queues are getting longer, and prices look likely to remain sluggish for the next two years and beyond. The Bank of England is taking unprecedented steps to fire up the U.K. economy and the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, says it's all going to take years to sort out. Let's look at exactly what the situation is within the United Kingdom. It really doesn't matter which way you look at it, unemployment, as in other parts of Europe, is becoming the key feature of this recession in the U.K., in the E.U., in the U.S., even in Japan where, of course, the absolute numbers are lower. But in the U.K., out of work, 2.4 million people. That is the highest number for 14 years, and gives a jobless unemployment rate of 7.8 percent. Crucial, it went up 220,000. Now although the pace of people losing their jobs has perhaps slowed down, they are still -- the numbers is still growing. So we are not at that point by any means in the recession where we can say that recovery or that growth is leading to a fall in unemployment. U.K. inflation is below 2 percent, expected to be -- remain that for the -- until 2012. We got the U.K. inflation report from the Bank of England. Now the significance of this particular number is that it gives the Bank of England and Mervyn King -- it gives them the ability to keep interest rates very low. And what we heard today from the governor was that interest rates would remain way down there for the foreseeable future. You'll be aware, of course, that not only monetary policy to interest rates, but also through printing money. This week the Bank of England's quantitative easing target is now $289 billion. So whether it is through QE or through interest rates, inflation is not a worry, it's unemployment that continues to be the big problem in the U.K. If you're out of a job, perhaps you may be feeling despair, but perhaps there is some hope. There are one or two sets, those that are seeing the beginnings of a recovery. We don't have much official evidence to prove it. Now the official numbers suggest one story, that if you look very closely, very closely indeed, there are signs in the street.

They have been very dramatic in terms of the facilities they've created, and they have helped working with the Central Banks around the world with the British Central Bank, with the European Central Bank, very good relation between the Treasury in the U.S. and the Federal Reserve.

It is now up 111 and the reason - what has happened in the last three seconds? The U.S. Federal Reserve has alerted to keep interested rates at on a historic low near zero. It's not what the Central Bank didn't do it. They're saying about the state of the US economy. Let me just go reading straight from what I'm seeing at the moment on the wires. The Federal Reserve has basically said, \\\"The economy is leveling out,\\\" and so the economy is leveling out. The Central Bank said it would shoot in one of its programs ending up propping up the economy, the quantitative easing of borrowing of buying bonds, corporate bonds and government bonds, CoCo bonds. So, quantitative easing is expected to come to an end in the U.S. in October and US interest rates remain unchanged and the economy is leveling out. Let's look at the Dow Jones up 121 at 1.3 percent, bringing Maggie Lake from New York and we start to see exactly. We can get some analysis on this decision. Maggie Lake joins me now. I think. Maggie nothing greatly surprising in terms of the interest rate decision, but I think it is a surprise they've decided to stop the bond purchases.\",\n",
      "            \"A little bit - not really Richard. I'd say it may be a relief instead of a surprise. But it was up in the air and nothing definitive. But certainly the market -- that's what they were really paying attention to. Listen, we knew they were going to keep interest rates at rock bottom for an extended period of time. They kept that language in the statement. But there may be a little relief, especially in the bond market. And here is why. That extraordinary measure to directly buy long-term Treasuries was creating some inflationary concerns longer out -- you know, further out on the horizon. So the fact that the Fed is sort of saying that they're going to stop that -- on schedule, by the way. That was when it was supposed to all wrap up. And they're not going to extend it. It means, to the market, two things, that they feel that the economy is stabilizing enough that they can start to take away that particular intervention and also it gives a little bit of relief on the inflation front. So I'd say that people were hoping that they were going to say that, yes, we're wrapping this up in October and that's exactly what they did. But remember, there's still an awful lot of Fed intervention in terms of that\",\n",
      "            \"OK...\",\n",
      "            \"No major changes announced there. They're going to be careful about taking away some of that other intervention. But the direct Treasury bond intervention, you're right. That is going to end.\",\n",
      "            \"I suppose I was surprised because of what we saw the Bank of England doing when it announced, obviously, it was continuing its quantitative -- its major quantitative easing of buying U.K. government guilt (ph). And -- that's a tautology. It's obviously guilt (ph). I see debt -- deficit numbers also out just now. July's budget deficit, $180 billion, taking the deficit this year to $1.2 trillion. Now, that is an extraordinary amount of money.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, it is. You know, there -- there are people that talk two sides of this trade deficit all the time. You know, some people wonder about the global economy once you start to -- even though these are huge numbers, they've been moving in, in a different direction. For years, they were much higher. Now they're moving the other way, of course, with the -- that U.S. Consumer out of the picture as the engine of growth. What does that mean for everybody else -- all these other countries that are export-driven? And there are other people who argue, hey, that number is still way too high. It should be even lower and the U.S. Should pursue more aggressive policies in that regard. So, you know, depending on inside or outside the beltway who you talk to, you've always got a different opinion about that. But just to circle back to the Fed again, Richard, you know, they were talking about, you know, some of the economy. And again, they're being very cautious. They're in a really tricky position here because they are saying that economic activity is leveling out. You hear words about stability and -- but also, at the same time, households being constrained. The Fed does not want to take away some of the stimulus that they have in the economy too soon, even when things are looking better, because they don't want to see, all of a sudden, the economy take another turn down. And it's a really tricky line they're walking. And a lot of economists are worried about how they're going to sort of extract themself from this situation. I'm sure you're hearing similar\",\n",
      "            \"All right, Maggie, we're going to be talking more about this in the days ahead. But thank you for that. Maggie Lake in New York joining me. Just to clarify, we've just heard that the U.S. Federal Reserve has kept U.S. Interest rates at an historic low, just about near zero -- known as zero bound, de facto. They also said the U.S. Economy is leveling out and they announced that they would stop the purchase of long-dated U.S. Government bonds, the program that was in place. And that would be stopped as planned in October. We'll talk more about that with Peter Morici, the professor, who joins us, one of the members of our economic family. He joins us just in about five to 10 minutes from now. Remember, they say good things really come to those who wait. Where's the place to go if you need a pint of smooth, creamy\"\n",

The revised projection by the University of Washington of the national death toll now down to 60,000 anticipated deaths by August. That's assuming the measures in place continue as they are. It's a reduction of about 20,000 deaths from the previous projection, and a significant reduction from previous ones that had it up to 240,000. So far, the global death toll from coronavirus, globally, is more than 87,000 deaths, nearly 1.5 million confirmed infected. And about 420,000 of those infected are in the United States. And while we cannot be sure of all the numbers being reported worldwide -- and, in fact, there's plenty of reason to doubt what governments such as China are reporting -- it is worth noting that, based on the available data, the United States, with roughly 4.25 percent of the world's population, has 28 percent of the world's confirmed cases of coronavirus and 16 percent of the world's reported fatalities.

The Department of Health and Human Services announcing GM will produce 30,000 ventilators for the National Stockpile, costing nearly half-a- billion dollars. Those will be delivered by the end of August, as hot spots across the country face concerns about meeting the needs today. Meantime, the conversation about how and when to reopen the country is starting, with a focus on antibody testing to learn who was infected, but asymptomatic.\",\n",

      "            \"Jake, at the Javits Center just behind me, there are 104 patients being treated here. Now, keep in mind, there are some 2,500 beds, and there have been a lot of questions about why there aren't more patients in those beds. Governor Cuomo said today that hospitals in the state are actually releasing more patients than are coming in. That's one good sign. Remember, he said hospitalizations are down. He also said, because there was so much preparation across the state, that they are not needing as many of the beds at this moment. This is overflow space, as is the Comfort. So, in his mind, that is a good thing that not as many beds are being used at the moment, Jake.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, the search for silver linings. Erica Hill, thank you so much. Appreciate it. Joining me now to discuss is, as always, CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay, good to see you, as always. So, this new model shows projected deaths down. And it's about -- at about 60,000, as anticipated, by August, an earlier peak for the virus coming in the next few days. And yet, at the same time that it's being revised down, we had the most deaths in a single day, period, just yesterday, more than 2,000. Help us make sense of this.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I think that both things can be true. These are still models that they're looking at. And, as you know, when you look at these numbers overall, you're seeing a sort of lag time, Jake. You're seeing these hospitalizations. And then people who are tested, they go to the hospital. That takes some time. Then if they, sadly, die, that's a week or so after that. So it's a little bit of a reflection of time in the past. I think what's interesting, when I really dove into these models, and talked to Chris Murray, the one that is sort of helping author these models, he's taking input now from other countries as well. Initially, the models were really based on China and saying, hey, if we do what China did, where would our models be, and sort of realizing that we couldn't necessarily do what China was doing in terms of stay- at-home orders. What's, I think, somewhat optimistic is that these other countries that have had stay-at-home orders, maybe not as strict as China or as early as China, have still had some benefit from that. And that has informed these models. Jake, when I take a closer look, though -- I just want to make this point -- even state by state. I have looked community by community in some of these models. There's wide variation still, Jake. So, New York, for example, I think I looked at the variation. It was somewhere between 300 to 1,800 people who may die during the peak days, so significant variation at each level. And so we have still got to be a little humble with regard to these models.\",\n",
      "            \"Right. They're not facts. They're just projections, based on the input of facts. Dr. Deborah Birx, who heads the Coronavirus Task Force at the White House, she said today that the Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., areas are expected to be the new hot spots. And she also said she's closely watching Houston. Is this just the virus making its expected way through other parts of the country? Is there something else going on?\",\n",
      "            \"I think there's a few things that are sort of informing that. One is, are these areas where you have big international airports? And that was relevant because it's likely that there was introduction and seeding of the virus going back to January, early February. And even now, a couple months later, you may start to see a significant community spread. We hope not, but you could see that. And, obviously, more densely populated areas, areas with public transportation, those are all some of the things that they're sort of focused in on, learning, obviously, a little bit from what has happened in New York. But, Jake, to your point, I mean, rural areas, I think, cannot necessarily breathe a sigh of relief yet.\",\n",
      "            \"Right.\",\n",
      "            \"We know that if you have even a couple, three cases in some of these communities, within days, there's better than a 50 percent chance that it's going to start to spread, you're going to see increased numbers. So this is the time to be vigilant still, no matter where you are in the country.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, I mean, people need to remember this all started, one person came into the country with it. Johns Hopkins University, which tracks coronavirus cases worldwide, they changed its trending designation overnight to down for the United States, meaning that the number of cases is going down on the five state rolling average or five state information. It's similar to current trending status for Italy and Spain. Is that significant? Or do we need to see what the next few days bring?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, I think that the next few days are going to be really important. But this-five day rolling average, I think, is a really interesting indicator. I have been following it for some time. And it's worth pointing out, as you say, the United States is down, so averaging these last five days, sort of made sense looking at the numbers. The three countries, Jake, that I have been following are actually five-day rolling average up. China's one of them. U.K. is one of them and Belgium. But China we got to pay attention to, right, Jake, because we're talking about sort of emerging from the shutdowns. Now, the numbers are still small, but you are seeing a five-day rolling average going up. So that could be concerning. And it may sort of prompt some more reinforced lockdown recommendations again. We will have to see what happens over there.\",\n",
      "            \"President Trump said yesterday he wants to open the economy with a bang. Dr. Fauci told lawmakers today that the task force is working on a framework to return Americans to -- quote -- \\\"normalcy.\\\" What are the metrics you're looking at to determine how and when governors and others should remove their stay-at-home orders?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, there are some very specific metrics. And, again, some of the people who are creating these models are also releasing some of these metrics. You have got to make sure the hospital capacity is there in order to take care of patients that continue to come in the hospital, obvious one. The cornerstone has to be testing. Jake, testing has always been important. We know it was very important at the beginning, where you had an inadequate response at that point. It's harder to actually trace people who come in as positive now because of the community spread. But at the end, at the downward side of this curve, testing, isolation, contact tracing is going to be very important to get there as well. As far as coming out with a bang, Jake, really, from a medical standpoint -- and I think Dr. Fauci has made this point and others have made this point -- until you have a vaccine, you probably can't say that. I mean, I think that, for a certain point, unless there's an amazing therapeutic which people feel very comfortable with, I think for some time to come, we will reemerge, I think schools, universities, businesses like that or similar businesses. But I think teleworking is still going to be a big thing. I think older people are still going to -- told, look, just limit the amount of time you're spreading out in the community. I think there's going to be some basic sort of thoughts still about reemergence until that vaccine comes or a really effective therapeutic, Jake.\",\n",

What we know about their conversations -- that's ahead. Stay with us.\",\n",
      "            \"Breaking news, just in, the results of a brand new CNN poll are now in. It shows a sharp drop in the views of the American public when it comes to the economy. I want to bring in CNN political director David Chalian. David, obviously, it's not a surprise, but a lot has changed in this last month, with most Americans stuck at home. Give us the numbers.\",\n",
      "            \"You're right, Jake, it may not be a surprise but it is dramatic. I don't ever recall seeing a drop like this. In just one month's time, we've seen, when ask people -- what do you make of the economic conditions in the country today, are they good? Only 39 percent said they're good, 69 percent said that a month ago. That's a drop of 30 percent. What is really interesting, also, Jake, though, people are optimistic it will be good a year from now, 67 percent in this poll say the economy will be good a year from now. That's about exactly where that optimistic number was just a month ago. So, while it impacted their immediate assessment of the economy, Americans are still quite optimistic a year from now they will be bouncing back.\",\n",
      "            \"That's interesting. And, David, almost half of those in this poll say that coronavirus has caused them financial hardship. The numbers are even more stark, of course, when you break it down according to income.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, we're seeing so much about sort of socioeconomic status play out in this, Jake. And if you look at people who have an income of less than $50,000 a year, 60 percent of them tell us in this poll that they are experiencing hardship due to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. When you look at people who earn more than $50,000 in household income annually, it's still 40 percent. Four in ten of those are experiencing hardship. So, like you said, you know, half the country says they're experiencing hardship but you do see the divide there economically.\",\n",

But that 44 percent number, Jake, who say it's not enough, I mean, that is why I think you see the congressional leaders very much already talking about the stimulus phases to come, that they're not done with this yet.\",\n",
      "            \"All right. David Chalian, thank you so much. In our money lead, as the layoffs stack up and Congress continues to try to help the public, a new video shows a Small Business Administration official calling out the big banks, big banks that took free bailout money in 2008, and this official accuses them of now turning their backs on small businesses. The new video was obtained by \\\"The Washington Post.\\\" Here's a little clip.\",\n",

      "            \"That was the Small Business Administration's district director in a webinar this past Monday. Let's bring in CNN business anchor Julia Chatterley. Julia, that SBA official specifically named Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Chase. He says big banks are only offering loans to existing small business customers, leaving others with no way to get this money. Are the banks doing that? And are they breaking any rules?\",\n",
      "            \"The lenders of all shapes and sizes, Jake, are asking and saying that, look, the rules keep change even on a daily basis, even as late as last night we were seeing tweaks. They're right that the big banks are lending to known customers, they say, look, we have the data, we can prevent fraud in this case, and ultimately, it's going to be quicker, which helps. But there are many small businesses falling through the gaps. These big banks have lent billions and billions over the last five days but it doesn't mean they can't do more and others can't do more. One banker said to me this week to that exact point, this is our opportunity to say, sorry, but the system needs fixing here too.\",\n",
      "            \"Uh-huh. Banks have committed $98 billion in loans since the stimulus program launched only last Friday, $349 billion are available, 349. We've heard about this overwhelming demand. So, why isn't the number of the dollars given out already, why isn't it bigger?\",\n",
      "            \"It's a great question. That $98 billion is for just the three largest banks alone, let's be clear. Wells Fargo is now going to boost that. But there are some immediate fixes that are required, from all the people I've spoken to. One, U.S. Treasury needs to send a written note to the lenders saying, get the money out there, you will not be fined. The second thing, the Small Business Administration needs to process these loans quicker somehow and open up access to the community banks to let them lend more too. Finally, to David's point, cash. Congress needs to get more cash to these businesses, promise more, and then everything will calm down.\",\n",

The key for me, and this is the good part of this, two-thirds of people still think the shock we're seeing is temporary, it will get better too. We have to protect that confidence at all costs. And we need to get cash to people, to states, to businesses, and we have to do it as fast as possible. We need a fix.\",\n",

So, help us understand what she's talking there. Dr. Birx says there are a number of test machines scattered throughout the United States. Eighty percent of them are not being used. What's going on here and why aren't they being used?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, some documents that have been leaked would indicate that in fact there's an intention to purchase these tests but they weren't made it to the ground where they need to be used, and that the numbers of tests that were intended to be sent to state and local labs are only about in the ballpark of 5,500 tests. So, 5,500 tests, and those are going to be allocated basically evenly across states regardless of whether they have many cases right now or not. It's not going to be on the basis of population size or real demand. So, those are -- those are a couple of things. But I can tell you, you know, if you're a lab director and you're sent one of these new Abbott machines, it's the shiny new toy in the lab, you're not going to let it sit there idle, you're going to put it to use. These things are not -- even once they receive them, are not plug and play, there is training that needs to be done. And then there are a couple of other issues that are going to be frustrating efforts to scale this up, which is that the nasal swabs and other mediums we use to collect specimens are also in short --\"\n",

Things like his efforts to raise the minimum wage. And he called the gap in incomes between the rich and the poor not only an economic issue but a moral issue. He also emphasized that he has been supporting human rights in situations around the world, including the situation currently in Ukraine and said that his emphasis on diplomacy also gels with the values that Pope Francis has really espoused to the world. Whether that is a deliberate kind of, you know, let's align this trip and what I'm trying to do with what the pope feels, it's not really sure. And, remember, this was an interview given to an Italian newspaper. Not something that was in the U.S. Although, of course, we know these comments circulate immediately around the world. And there was an exchange of gifts. Pope Francis gave President Obama a medallion. The president said that he will treasure it. He also gave him an encyclical of the pope's readings. And the president cracked a few jokes during this. He said, oh, this will be great. I can read this while I'm deeply frustrated, for example, in the Oval Office, saying that the pope's writings would give him strength and a sense of peace or calm. Turns out that encyclical contains something of a criticism of the free market system. And the president also made a joke saying that he thinks the pope is probably the only person in the world who has to put up with more protocol than he does. And we certainly saw a lot of Vatican pomp and circumstance throughout this. Those rare pictures from inside the papal palace. A place, in fact, that this pope has declined to live in, saying it's just too ornate for his taste and goes against what he's been trying to really strengthen in the Catholic Church, what he says being poor among the poor. Carol.\",\n",

Usually it takes pressure from the outside, from concerned parents, dentists, pediatricians.

They are much more wealthy than those Wall Street people with their golden parachutes, they're cronyism, their corruption, their influence peddling which is wreaking havoc in our global economy.

And I thank CNN for bringing these wonderful people to the forefront, especially at such a time where we see the greed and we see the selfishness, we see the corruption that is not only on Wall Street but also that's in government.

She threw out her chicken bones, these kids came running to the trash can just to stuck on the chicken bones because they had no food. So what has she done?

The Good Samaritan, the story that Jesus talked about, a man was on a journey, fell into robbers and he was beaten and robbed and left for dead, and people came by and they noticed, but it was a samaritan that stopped to help him. I see Anne as like a modern day samaritan, stopping along the street, finding these people and challenging them to come run with her. And the hope and the inspiration that she has given to so many of these people in the streets -- it was an inspiration to me. And I'm a runner. I'm not very good runner.

You know, so right now the talk is all about me and us versus them. When, in fact, in the deeper domains of awareness and spiritualities, that domain of awareness where we experience our universality. And when we experience our universality then we experience the intention to help others because we see that we are inseparable from them. We experience love, compassion, loving kindness, equanimity and -- research also shows that the best way to be happy is to make other people happy. Money brings some comfort, but it is not the source of happiness. People in Nigeria, in Venezuela, in Puerto Rico and Mexico are happier than in the United States. The research shows that when you see problems and find opportunities and when you help other people, it increases your happiness, too.\",\n",

The Pope came out earlier this week, for the sake of all religions here, and he said that the bank situation, the crisis on Wall Street, is showing that banking is built on a house of sand, and that faith in God is the most important thing. I'm guessing that you agree with that?\",\n",

We need to ask for God's forgiveness, we need to repent of our sins. And we need to come to him and humble ourselves. The Bible says if we do that, that he will not only heal our hearts but he'll heal our land. America needs to be healed, and it needs to be healed by God.

Yesterday, the local medical examiner did call the incident a homicide, but police are investigating it so far as an accidental shooting. Today's \\\"New York Post\\\" says Williams almost shot New Jersey Jets football player Wayne Chrebet, or New York Jets football player Wayne Chrebet, in an incident on the shooting range at his sprawling New Jersey estate, at which New York Giant Jason Sehorn was also present.

Reports first labeled the shooting a suicide. The Hunterdon County medical examiner now ruling a homicide caused by a gunshot wound to the chest and abdomen at intermediate range. Authorities have told several news organizations that Williams had shotguns in his home. He also had a skeet shooting range on his property. Williams loved the sprawling estate he and his father built, calling it Who Knew, always eager to show it off. That night, Christofi was hired to drive Williams and his friends around, taking them to dinner outside Philadelphia, according to the limo company. Williams gave a late night impromptu tour of his home to his friends, including four of the Harlem Globetrotters, according to a spokesman for the team.

They, his own book recounts several incidents, one where his dad shot a kid who had refused to pay a bet to Jayson after he lost to him in a pool game. The father came to the pool hall, hit the other kid with a pool cue and then shot him in the buttocks. One of Jayson's brothers shot the other one over some sort of disagreement with a .410 shotgun and Jayson's mother once fired, apparently, three shots at his father, who was in the bathroom, because dad apparently had been wandering astray. And then, of course, there's that well publicized incident when Jason Sehorn and Wayne Chrebet were down at Jayson's home and apparently he wasn't, according to these accounts of the incident on the shooting range, he wasn't real careful when it came to handling firearms.\",\n",

You know, having not been around him and never been around him and his firearms, I don't know exactly, you know, how true or untrue that is. I will say this, this was a guy that broke into the NBA, came up from the Lower East Side in New York, really didn't have a lot going for him early in life until basketball came to him and he basically broke out of a very bad situation to make it in the NBA.

And when he did, it was one of the great success stories in the league. So, you know, it's just hard for me to reconcile that person with somebody who was involved in the death of another man.

      "            \"Breaking news tonight. A fierce battle is underway in Georgia. And it could have major implications for President Trump and the republicans. Results are coming in this highly anticipated special congressional election. Who will win and what does it mean for the Trump presidency? There it is right there you see it up on your screen. This is CNN Tonight. I'm Don Lemon. The House seat has been in republican hands for decades, but a young democrat, Jon Ossoff is leading in early returns. If he wins, if he wins and he needs to get over 50 percent in order to win in a crowded field. It is a major upset for republicans and could mean the GOP's House majority is in jeopardy in 2018 midterms. Is this really a referendum on President Trump? We're going to discuss all that. I want to get look at the returns so far. Let's put them up. Democrat Jon Ossoff has 51 percent right now, they're up on the screen. Fifty-one percent. Again, he needs 50 percent to avoid a runoff and win outright. The next person behind him, Karen Handel, 18.1 percent. We have been watching the returns all night and the race has been tightening. And I want to begin with CNN's senior congressional reporter Manu Raju who is in Atlanta. He is following this for us. Jim Acosta is at the White House, he is following this for us as well. He's our White House correspondent, of course. Manu, to you first. You're at democrat Jon Ossoff's headquarters tonight. What is the mood like right now?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, it's pretty energetic here. There's a lot of anxiety in the room as the crowd waits for those results. But I can tell you, Don, there's been actually shift on the republican side over the last half an hour or so as more results have come in from one or two counties. Cob County where republicans had hoped that they could keep Mr. Ossoff below 48 percent of the vote in that republican strong vote right now. Ossoff with a 90 percent of the votes coming in, in that county about 42 percent. Now there are still a lot of votes outstanding, Don, including in Fulton County where there are actually just 19 of 100 of 1,0115 precincts that have actually come in so far. Meaning there's a lot of that vote that we're still waiting to hear. And both Karen Handel, the republican candidate is number two and also Jon Ossoff expected to make significant end rows. But the feeling right now, Don, is that...\",\n",
      "            \"Manu, I don't want to -- I hate to cut you off. I just want to tell you we have some new totals up as you're speaking. But Jon Ossoff is at 50.1 percent with the latest totals that we have. Sixty nine percent of the tallies are in. Go, continue on, Manu.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. You know, the feeling right now, Don, is that's going to be tough to maintain the 50 plus threshold that he needs to avoid a runoff. That is something that both republicans and democrats right now are skeptical that he can reach at this point unless something significant changes in the numbers. So the chances are still pretty high that we're going to end up in a two person run off on June 20th. But I still caution a long way to go. A lot of votes still outstanding and we don't know what's going to be. It's going to be close to that 50 percent number, even if Mr. Ossoff's falls just short, Don.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. You're right. The mood there at Jon Ossoff's headquarters seem -- I mean, it seems to be pretty jubilant. People are celebrating behind you, at least very happy behind you, Manu. I have to ask you. I want to get Jim. Let's go to Jim first and then we'll get back to Manu. Jim, why is the president so invested in this congressional race? He sent six tweets, he's done robo calls.\",\n",
      "            \"He doesn't like to lose, Don. I think that the sense we're getting from over here at the White House is that if Jon Ossoff wins this race, that I think the president is going to feel this is some sort of a loss on his part. We were talking to a White House official earlier this evening who indicated there's some hammering been going on inside this White House. They feel if Jon Ossoff wins tonight, that there's going to be a bad news cycle tomorrow. That they are going to have to deal with. The Press Secretary Sean Spicer has a briefing schedule before noon, obviously if Jon Ossoff wins and clears that 50 percent threshold, the 50 percent plus 1 vote threshold, there's going to be lot of unpleasant questions for Sean Spicer to deal with tomorrow. But I was talking to a White House official earlier today who was saying, yes, the president was personally invested in this that's why he recorded that robo call, that's why he was sending out those tweets. And the feeling was here at the White House if they had not done that, and Jon Ossoff were to win they would have been slammed. But, Don, you can see a situation where in either scenario they were going to receive some criticism. But in the event that Jon Ossoff does not clear this 50 percent threshold, there is some feeling of confidence inside the White House that, well, if it's between Jon Ossoff and say Karen Handel, the leading republican candidate there, there is some confidence inside the White House that they should be able to hold this off and have some sort of victory. But I was talking to some republican sources just this evening, Don, who were saying, wait a minute, Reince Priebus is the former RNC chair, he's the White House chief of staff. You know, if Jon Ossoff wins this race there's a feeling of some republican operatives here in Washington that the White House should have seen this coming, they should have done more to prevent this, perhaps have the president endorse one of these candidates. He did not endorse one of these candidates, Don. He got essentially in Jon Ossoff's face in tweeting all sorts of things about him all week long but he did not get behind a particular candidate. Now in the event that Jon Ossoff does not clear that 50 percent, does not win the run off, you can expect a tweet that we saw from the president a couple of days ago. You can see some of these tweets that are o screen right now. A couple of days ago he tweeted \\\"The recent Kansas election was a really big media event. And so the republicans won. Now they play the same game with Georgia, bad.\\\" If the president somehow comes out ahead in all of this I think you can expect some crowing out of the Oval Office that he feels like he was right once again, Don.\",\n",
      "            \"All right, Jim, I want you to stand by. It's going to be a long night. Maybe Manu stand by as well. I want to bring in now my political panel. Margaret Hoover is here, Gloria Borger, David Chalian, Hilary Rosen, and Jack Kingston. Good evening to you. Wow, election night all over again. So, Gloria, let's talk about this Georgia congressional seat. It's a ruby red district. Crowded field. Eighteen candidates including 11 republicans and 4 democrats. Explain why this one race has taken on such an outsized significance.\",\n",
      "            \"Because it's precisely the kind of districts that democrats salivate over when they think about potentially taking back the House in 2018 or at least gaining a number of seats. This is as you know well, Don, because you lived in Atlanta. This is a suburban district that is diverse, it is highly educated. It is wealthier. It's just the -- and it's younger. So, it's just the kind of districts that democrats believe that they could potentially flip. So when this comes up for grabs and you see a large group of republicans, you know, forming a circular firing squad and you see a young candidate out there who is unexceptional by the way, but has some appeal and you put 9 or $10 million behind him, which they have done, they think it's an opportunity to create momentum for themselves going into 2018 and embarrass the president.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I'm wondering if this a win already before. Because I was in Atlanta a couple of weeks ago for a wedding and I saw, you know, I sort of got tuned into this election and I said there's a democrat that stands a chance? There's a democrat at 50 percent now on election night. I mean, what message does this send to the president and republicans, David?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, the message that it sends is this is not Newt Gingrich's district as you may remember at one as Gloria is saying the shifting demographics. But the other message is these are not trump republicans and the leading republican is a key example of that. Karen Handel a much more mainstream, Mitt Romney style republican, if you will, who won this district by 23 points in 2012, Don. What I think you will see here is that you have -- let's say it's heading to a run off. We've seen Ossoff's going down the whole way. Credit to the republicans they understood mission one here was to get enough turnout of their voters in this reliably republican district to keep him below 50. But now on to the real battle because this is not going to get any less competitive.\",\n",
      "            \"Right.\",\n",
      "            \"They may be trickier for Jon Ossoff to go one on one against the republicans in this district than a divided field of 11 republicans, Don. But the money that Gloria was just talking about, that's going to keep flooding in. The energy with the democrats is going to keep coming into the district and so this is going to be a competitive race now if it goes to a run off all the way through June.\",\n",
      "            \"All right. Margaret is going to hit me if I don't let her in right now. Go ahead, Margaret.\",\n",

      "            \"Call on me.\",\n",
      "            \"Money. I just want to point out we're talking about a lot of money here on the table. There's lot of outside money and there are a lot of hard dollars on this race. So, as we know. And look, $7.2 million in outside republican money flooded into this race. And as you mention, David, it's 11 republican candidates and one democrat. There's no wonder that he's leading with barely 50 percent and republicans are all divided. It's actually quite shocking that Karen Handel has emerged from that field as really the strong second contender. I think that's what is noteworthy and also just another data point on this district. The median income in this district is $72,000 for a family household. That is significant higher. David, you're right. This is not Trump republican country but these are mainstream republicans.\",\n",

And now we've seen as the president is engaged against him. And so for all of those republicans in the House who are, you know, have won their districts by less than, you know, 10 points they're all wondering is Donald Trump going to help me in 2018 or is he going to hurt me? Because if Jon Ossoff does well tonight, people are going to start to worry that maybe this president is a liability in their district and not a help.\",\n",

They made sure that there were not going to be any defections. I've been talking to the top Republicans for the last several days, they felt very confident heading into this vote because they got assurances from all their members from some of those blue states, swing state Republicans that you folks were just talking about, people like Dean Heller from Nevada or Pat Toomey from Pennsylvania, that they we're not going to flip, that they were going to support Betsy Devos no matter how much pressure was coming from the left flank of the Democratic caucus. And that was one reason why they moved up for consideration of her nomination to have that before Jeff Sessions' vote to ensure that Jeff Session who was there to help break that 50-50 tie and help it to get to 51-50 situation. Now the Senate moving to the rest of Donald Trump's Cabinet, John, that's right, this vote that's happening at this moment to break a filibuster to block Jeff Sessions from getting the job. Jeff Sessions expected to overcome that filibuster and watch for the Republicans to push through the rest of Donald Trump's cabinet nominees at a very slow pace, much slower than a lot of new presidents but eventually they're going to get their jobs.

The president says he wants fast action. We know at the Whit House they're already frustrated with the pace of Congress but if -- you have to have the vice president break a tie to get you an education secretary, what does it look like as we head into the contentious policy debates about funding a border wall, replacing Obamacare, potentially the whole terror ban issue is spilling up on Capitol Hill, tax reform?\",\n",

It happens slower than they wanted, but it's still happening, but this is the part that they expected to get done. Now, what about when you start getting into the really heavy part of the legislative calendar, getting into the nitty-gritty of healthcare reform, of tax reform. It's going to be incredibly difficult not just to keep Republicans united but to get Democratic support on key issues overcoming that 60-vote threshold which you'll need to pass massive pieces legislation or even the most policy measures, getting of eight Democrats join with 52 Republicans if the Republicans can stay united and, John, this going to frustrate House Republicans who want fast action on a lot of issues, including Obamacare but given how slow the Senate is moving as we've seen with these cabinet nominees, it's going to be very difficult to move quickly on major elements of the agenda so it could spark some infighting which we'll watch for in the coming weeks and months, John.\",\n",

But at this moment it's just dawned on me when Manu was speaking, the President is going to go up there. It's not a state of the union because he wasn't president last year, but he's going to go up there in just a couple of weeks and give a joint address to the American people and to the joint session of Congress. He has not done much early on to reach out to the other side. Nor have they done much to reach out to him.

He's saying look, we wanted to inspect the ballots that were left over, a kind of after election day that were to be counted, and the supervisor of elections in Broward, Brenda Snipes, didn't make them available. She didn't make any lists available and the like. And in addition to that, he essentially called on the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate, and incidentally Politico just confirmed that FDLE, which is kind of the state's version of the FBI, is investigating to see if there were any kind of any shenanigans that were happening. part of the problem here is Brenda Snipes' office in Broward County, the office is perpetually involved in a number of elections controversies and most people who have to interface with the office, that is, candidates, politicians, political scientists and reporters have generally walked away with the impression that is utterly inept. Now some people also believe that perhaps under the cover of this ineptness someone could have smuggled in a bunch of ballots right now. That's just conspiracy theory. There's no evidence for it. It's possible. But what we do know is that time and time again when other counties are finished counting ballots, even a bigger county, Miami- Dade County where I'm broadcasting from, finished its counting of absentee ballots much earlier than Broward and Broward essentially has no excuse.\",\n",

You know, requiring different forms of I.D., not requiring -- allowing certain forms of I.D. and not requiring others in an effort to shrink the electorate and have claimed fraud in a number of cases in a number of ways. So, when you have then the president, who has you say, Don, is on Twitter tonight saying, you know, Scott should have won when he was the one just a couple of years ago talking about, you know, millions of illegal ballots cast with no evidence, it just fuels the idea that Republicans are crying wolf. But to go back to Broward County you have to count these votes carefully. I do think you have to at least have a situation where the courts supervise some kind of neutral party, whether it's law enforcement or someone else, look into this because at the end of the day people should be able to at least agree that whatever ballots were cast should be counted.

As teams scramble to fill that void, I think, to me, it made the absence of JaMarcus Russell all the more pronounced. Here was the number-one quarterback four years ago, nowhere on anyone's radar, and yet teams are desperate to fill that position. It's strange times in football.

They went over the bird flu pandemic scenario. They had gotten a peek at it about a week ago. They did identify some gaps: adequate vaccines, anti-viral treatment.

This weekend he's weighing a clemency request to spare the life of Stanley \\\"Tookie\\\" Williams. A decision is expected soon. Convicted of killing four people in 1979, Williams is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Tuesday.

Supporters say he's a positive influence, worth saving. Granting clemency is, in any case, very complicated.

During that period, clemency was also much more common. Nationwide more than 200 inmates were spared from death sentences between 1960 and 1970. While clemency has only been granted 63 times in the last three decades. That's not including the 167 inmates whose death sentences were commuted by the governor of Illinois in 2003. That was a story unto itself. The state of California doesn't execute people very often. Despite having more than 600 inmates on death row, only 11 people have been executed in California since the death penalty was reinstated in the late 70's. The state of Texas has 400 inmates currently on death row and has executed 355 people since the death penalty was reinstated.\",\n",

And I think the Israeli prime minister, I think, recognized the gravity of a ground invasion of Gaza. And Hamas also recognized that a ground invasion of Gaza would deliver a hard blow. And both Egypt and the United States played a pivotal role. Egypt because it exercises tremendous influence over Hamas and the United States basically impressed on Prime Minister Netanyahu the need to basically deescalate as opposed to go for a ground invasion. So both the geostrategic realties on the ground between Israel and between Hamas and also in the region and the international system. The question is, as you said, how do you build on the cease fire? How do you, as Secretary Hillary Clinton said, this is just the first step. What comes after this first step is very critical for both Israel and the Palestinians and for the peace process.\",\n",
      "            \"Right. What about, though, in terms of who really deserves the credit for getting this deal done and getting this cease-fire agreed upon? Does that lie squarely with Egypt's president? I mean his skill, Mohamed Morsi's skill at navigating this minefield between the two was certainly impressive.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I would say that the winner was Morsi. The winner was Egypt, because Egypt was able to play a major role in convincing Hamas and also in trying to impress on Israel that any major ground invasion would have serious repercussions. In the word of the Egyptian president, Mohammed Mori, on Egyptian-Israeli relations. Remember, Egypt is very pivotal. It was the first step -- state to sign a peace treaty with Israel. The Camp David Peace Accords. So in this particular sense, even Israeli prime minister recognized the pivotal role of Egypt. So, yes, Egypt is very pivotal, but let's not underestimate the role of the Obama administration and his ability to put all the pieces together. Without the United States, I would not -- I would argue there will be no political horizon, that the peace process will not be revived. That's why I'm hoping that President Barack Obama, in his second term, will invest political capital in bringing about -- in helping to bring about a two-state solution, a secure Jewish state and also as independence and viable Palestinian state that deals with the root causes of the fighting between Hamas and Israel.\",\n",
      "            \"And getting back to Mohamed Morsi and Egypt. I mean, Morsi may be getting pats on the back from the international community, but at home certainly much different right now, declaring a whole lot of power. Did he use the cover of the Israel-Gaza conflict, do you think, to enact his new powers?\",\n",
      "            \"I have no doubt in my mind that Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi has proved to be very shrewd and calculating. Using this particular moment that basically everyone praised Morsi. The Americans, the Israelis, the Europeans. He used this particular moment to really make a coup. He anointed himself a supreme leader with absolute power. He's basically trying to re-create an imperial presidency in Egypt. Remember, what he has done is that there is no authority, no authority in Egypt, that can override any decision that he has made. And, yes, you're absolutely correct. Unfortunately for the Egyptian people, Mohamed Morsi's behavior does not differ very much from that of Mubarak. And that's why what he done basically has, I would argue, exacerbated social and political tensions and widened the cleavages between Morsi and the various political groups in Egypt. This is why Egypt is in turmoil. And, unfortunately for the Egyptian people, I think Egypt remains, I would argue, a work in progresses in terms of democratization and institutionalization.\",\n",
      "            \"Right. Amazing after all they've been through to see the protesters holding signs about Morsi, calling him a dictator. We will continue to watch this. Fawaz Gerges, thank you very much. And next hour, more on the prospects for lasting peace in the Middle East. We'll talk about Iran's role in the region. So be sure to stay with us.

      "            \"Tonight, in \\\"Raw Politics\\\": the end of an era and the possible rise of the Palin era. Justice John Paul Stevens announced he's going to retire at the end of his term. He served nearly 35 years, turns 90 this month. This means, of course, that President Obama has a major decision to make. And the question is, who is going to fill Stevens' seat? Jeff Toobin has some ideas on that in a moment. Also, in New Orleans, Sarah Palin gave a speech packed with smiles and sarcasm at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference, drawing a standing ovation at one point. She also took another shot at President Obama, whom she blasted earlier this week for rewriting the U.S. nuclear defense policy, something Ronald Reagan had talked about long ago. Mr. Obama then responded on \\\"Good Morning America\\\" to a question about Palin from George Stephanopoulos, saying, the last time he checked, she was no expert on nuclear policy. Today, Palin responded. Take a look. (\",\n",
      "            \"I really have no response to that. The last I checked, Sarah Palin is not much of an expert on nuclear issues. If the secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are comfortable with it, I'm probably going to take my advice from them, and not from Sarah Palin.\",\n",
      "            \"Now, the president, with all the vast nuclear experience that he acquired as a community organizer...\",\n",
      "            \"... and as a part-time senator, and as a full-time candidate, all that experience, still no accomplishment to date with North Korea and Iran.\",\n",
      "            \"Candy Crowley is in New Orleans. She was there for the speech. Also with us, senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. He's also author of \\\"The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court,\\\" which is a great book, also Reihan Salam, contributor at The Daily Beast and co-author of \\\"Grand New Party.\\\" Candy, let's start with you. Did Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty skip this event because they knew there was no way they would compete with Sarah Palin there?\",\n",
      "            \"They would give you other reasons. Romney is a on a book tour. Pawlenty had some troops coming home from Iran and Afghanistan. But, listen, there is no doubt that she really absorbs much of the sun. And you saw that here today with the reception she got. There were others, Newt Gingrich. He is -- gave a speech that was very warmly received, but it's not that same temperature that she can bring a room to. She is just lightning when she comes in. And she sparks a lot of enthusiasm. I mean, they rushed the stage to get her autograph. She came in and, when they opened the doors, everybody kind of hurried in to get a good seat. So, there's just no one like Palin to kind of move a crowd. And, of course, they're having a straw vote tomorrow here. And while it won't matter probably a week from now, much less two years from now, it still gives another headline to someone. So, if you're also running for president, maybe you don't want to be compared giving a speech from the same podium.\",\n",
      "            \"Reihan, it was interesting. I mean, last night, Newt Gingrich said the Republicans have to be the party of yes, and was saying, wherever you go, whoever you talk to, say it's the party of yes. Today, Sarah Palin said, it's fine with her if they're not only the party of no, but the party of hell no.\",\n",
      "            \"I think that it's basically a matter of drawing a sharp contrast. It's basically a matter of really trying to connect with the conservative grassroots. And I think it's very shrewd. A lot are folks are talking about this as her debut, coming out, demonstrating that she really is going to be a presidential candidate. The thing is that it makes sense for her to make us all think that she's going to be a presidential candidate, and you can imagine her being someone who really fires up the base, without actually pulling the trigger. So, I think we still don't know what exactly her intentions are for 2012.\",\n",

Once they get a short list for a first nominee, it tends to continue into the second nominee.

It's through the vehicle of Supreme Court confirmation hearings. And, you know, by and large, the president gets his way. When the president's party controls the Senate, as it does now by a wide margin, 59-41, no -- no nominee has lost since the 1960s. So, I think it's unlikely that any Obama nominee would lose.\",\n",

      "            \"You see a ratchet effect, basically. I mean, you know, from 2000 to now, you see more and more votes of the opposition party going against a nominee. You saw it with, you know, Roberts vs. Alito. And I think that that ratchet just keeps continuing. I think that Garland, a lot of liberals thought that he would be the person to go in there if you had a conservative justice retire. Then you have him go in. But now it seems the politics have gotten so difficult, that he becomes more plausible now. I think the real thing about Stevens is that he was a guy who was able to bring Kennedy on board. He was the absolutely crucial liberal because he was a guy who could build coalitions. And I think that, if Obama is going to be strategic about this -- and I think that that's his intention -- I think that he's given a lot of thought to this -- he's going to want to find someone who can do that. And I think that Republicans understand that they basically have to put up a fight, whoever it is, even if it's someone who is more congenial to them, like Garland or like Kagan.\",\n",
      "            \"But look at where Candy is. That's today's Republican Party. We talk about the base of the party. That's all there is, is the base of a party. There are no more moderate Republicans. And that is a Republican Party that is going to oppose, regardless of which nominee it is.\",\n",

      "            \"Well, listen, I mean, just let me give you some numbers here, I think ones that we all know. It's going to take 60 votes to get this nominee through the Senate. Right now, Democrats have 59 votes, including two independents. There are Republicans up on Capitol Hill who believe that, barring some horrible thing, barring, you know, a resume that shows that a person is not qualified to sit on the Supreme Court, that a president ought to have the nominee he wants, even if it's a president from the other party. They just fundamentally believe in the principle that they're not going to argue with the judicial views of a candidate. They want to know if this person is qualified, and, if so, after talking about the views, they will go ahead and vote for them. You just need one to do that. So, do I think that there will be a lot of noise? I do. Why? It's an election year. And no place is the idea of the power to put someone on the Supreme Court as effective a campaigning tool as in the Republican Party. This is very near to their hearts because of the social issues that Jeffrey just talked about. So, yes, I think it will be part of the political mix, but I think, if you look at the sheer numbers of it that, certainly, the president is likely to get his nominee.\",\n",

He said about 3,600 of those that had been transported so far were militants. Obviously, the rest of them are civilians, and obviously there's a good deal of militants and civilians, their families mainly, that are left behind in the suburbs of Damascus. Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, earlier said that it would take several days -- he said this yesterday, it would take several days before this evacuation operation is complete. You're right, he did say that the safety of those that choose to leave was being guaranteed both by the Russians and by the Syrian military. But he also said it would be those that chose to stay -- he hesitated and said it is their choice. And so that's obviously concerning for those that have chosen not to take advantage of this corridor out of the city. All this comes, Becky, as Russia deepens its contacts, deepens its involvement in the Syrian conflict. For the time this weekend, Russian state television broadcast images of its special forces carrying out operations on the ground in Syria. Take a look.\",\n",
      "            \"The Kremlin never denied having special forces in Syria, this is the first time we've seen their notorious specsnats (ph). Russia state television broadcast these extraordinary images at the weekend, including at this missile strike and what they say was a rebel convoy. Russia (inaudible) says the targets include jihadi fighters from former Soviet states neutralized is the word used to prevent them from returning home, justifying military's role in Syria. \\\"Such is the secrecy of the operations,\\\" says this man described as a special forces soldier, \\\"that even our wives don't know where we've been.\\\" Islamic State pays big money, he tells the Russian state TV reporter, to find out who we are. The Kremlin says this fight against terrorism in Syria should be shared with the United States. No mention of the civilians trapped with no way out in a humanitarian crisis. Up until now, that idea of a shared fight with the Kremlin has been pretty much dismissed. The humanitarian toll of Russian airstrikes, and its strong backing of a despised Syrian president placed Moscow and Washington on opposite sides of the conflict. But that was before the election of Donald Trump and his choice of Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. They're both seen as much more sympathetic to the Russian view. And although the Kremlin tells CNN it's not expecting a sudden change in U.S. policy on Syria, it says that it's hopeful of more dialogue and cooperation. It's unclear what form that cooperation may take, but as the Kremlin now actively promotes the work of its special forces in Syria, it knows the killing of jihadis is one area President-elect Trump will be keen to support.\",\n",

And so the message very much on state television now is that there are real security reasons why Russian forces are in Syria. And they seem to be pulling out all the stops to try and ram that message home.\",\n",

We talked a lot about this September last when Russia's involvement began. And it was unclear at that stage what the endgame was. Is it any clearer at this stage? Is the idea that once Aleppo is gone, there's a sort of retraction and a possibility that Russia will offer up some sort of political solution as the next phase with what is a new incoming U.S. administration that they may be able to work closer with going forward?\",\n",

And I think that, you know, whatever the concerns were and the proposals were and the thoughts were before Donald Trump was elected into the White House, that will have to develop now, now that that equation is changing. And with a new sense that there could be a different attitude coming from the United States towards what Russia is doing inside Syria. I mean, look, the Syrian president has made no bones about it, he wants to take control over the rest of the country. He said that repeatedly in various interviews. I don't see a situation where the Russians are going to withdraw at this point. There's no reason for it. And I think we have to remember that the Russians went there with their primary purpose which was to send a powerful message to the world that this is a country that's back on the international stage, a country that supports its allies, and a country that won't let regime change take place in favor of, you know, organizations or governments that are favorable towards the west without a fight. And that's a message and achievement that's already been pretty much -- a message that's already been pretty much established by the Russians.\",\n",
      "            \"Matthew Chance is in Moscow with analysis for you this evening. Matthew, always a pleasure. Thank you very much indeed. Well, Japan's prime minister urging Russia to take action to alleviate human suffering in Syria. Shinzo Abe expressed serious concern over Syria, the first ever meeting with the Russian President Vladimir Putin. A Japanese government official reported the developments and said the two leaders also discussed North Korea, Ukraine, and missile defense. Well, as Andrew Stevens reports, Japan and Russia are trying to forge a close-up relationship. He has the latest on the summit, which is taking place at a hot springs resort in Nagato in Japan.\",\n",
      "            \"Becky, it's been called the Onsen (ph) summit after the Japanese word for hot springs. And it was more of an informal setting for Shinzo Abe to meet with Vladimir Putin in Shinzo Abe's hometown. This, though, is a meeting where both sides are moving to try to get close to each other. Japan partly to offset the influence of China in this region, and Russia because sanctions are biting and it's looking for new opportunities in the east. But the key topic of the conversation today was about four islands, which were seized by Russia just after the Second World War that Japan claims ownership of. And Shinzo Abe wanted to start the ball rolling, get the conversation going about eventually getting those islands returned to Japan. It is going to be a long process, though, expect no breakthroughs. There was also talks about economic measures provided by Japan for Russia. They're going to be quite small. And Japan has to walk a fine line, because there are sanctions imposed by the G7 of which Japan is a member on Russia after the annexation of Crimea back in 2014, so Japan can't be seen to be busting any of those sanctions, although it's likely that nothing will give Vladimir Putin more pleasure than to see some crack in the unity of the G7 over sanctions. But there will be announcements about economic ties being strengthened between the two countries. There's already been an announcement from the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov that security talks between the defense and foreign ministers from both countries will resume again. So, this is a move to try to bring the two countries closer together, improve ties, shore up alliances. And as we've seen it started informally. Tomorrow, Friday, will be more formal when economic issues will be at the forefront -- Becky.\",\n",
      "            \"Andrew Stevens reporting for you. Breaking news in the past hour. We have learned that traces of explosive material have been found on the victims of EgyptAir Flight 804. The plane crashed in the Mediterranean Sea back in May, killing 66 people. I want to bring in my colleague Nic Robertson who has got the very latest details from London. Before we do that, Nic, let's just remind our viewers what happened with this flight. EgyptAir Flight 804 went down in May -- May 19 to be precise of this year. The AirBus A-320 was en route from Paris to Cairo when it crashed into the Med, killing all 66 people on board. Searchers found the plane's flight data recorded and cockpit voice recorder in June. While the cause of the crash remains unknown, that voice recorder indicated there was at least a fire on board the plane and an attempt to put it out before the crash. So, Nic, what have we found out today?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, what the Egyptian officials are saying, the committee that's been investigating, they found traces of explosives on some of the victims and they say they're referring that to the prosecutor. So, what are they really saying here, they're saying that there was a bomb on board and that brought the plane down and we should find out who is responsible. There was a lot of talk at the time when this place came down that bombs on board Egyptian aircraft were a very sensitive thing. There had been one just six months before on board a flight flying from Sharm el Sheikh to St. Petersburg. Everyone on that aircraft was killed. And it was brought down by a bomb. Russian officials found the residue on the victims within days. This has taken some six months. But what do we know about this aircraft? Well, it was flying at 37,000 feet as everyone expected to be on the correct flight path, Greek air traffic control heard it or saw it on the radar, taking a turn to the left by 90 degrees, then swinging back around to the right 360 degrees, that was the first indication that something was wrong on board the aircraft. The transmission device on the aircraft that transmits out data of what's happening, said that there was a smoke detection in the lavatory and in the cockpit as well. That was replicated eventually when the flight data recorder was recovered and repaired in France and came back to Egyptian authorities. The voice recorder, also as you said indicated that the air crew were trying to put out a fire. So, six months later, or five months later, we're learning now that there was explosive residue, potentially involved on some of the victims here. People -- news organizations locked into the 24 hours prior to this crash discovered that the aircraft that had three emergency landings in the 24 hours prior. So, one of the questions that was raised at the time that this aircraft went missing was what was its flight service history like. So, I think all these questions are going to resurface again, but the Egyptian authorities are clearly pointing everyone in one direction now, and that is towards the supposition that potentially an explosive device was actually on board the aircraft, Becky.\",\n",

      "            \"All right, welcome back. I'm John Berman in Daytona Beach, Florida. Hurricane Dorian is churning out in the ocean behind me. You can see the force of this storm. The sea is just kicking. And they've been that way for a day, and I think they will continue for some time as the storm moves up the coast. The news this morning is Hurricane Dorian is on the move, finally on the move, moving steadily up the Florida peninsula. There is a sense of cautious optimism from where I am south this morning that the worst of it, that they have been spared the worst of Hurricane Dorian. There have been several thousand power outages, nothing too horrible. But while there might be optimism to the south, in that direction to the north, I think there is increasing concern this morning, that's because the storm has drifted a little bit west. Still in the predicted path but very close to the coast as it reaches South Carolina perhaps making landfall. And it doesn't have to make landfall to be very danger there. There's enormous concern about storm surge there in the low country. There have been evacuations. Several people have moved off the coast inland because there's so much concern about this storm, and landfall is still very, very possible there. That would happen tomorrow, so we'll be watching this storm very closely for some time. That's where it's going, where it's already been, so much damage. We are getting a sense of the impact in the Bahamas. We know of seven fatalities so far, but that number could rise and could rise significantly. Our Patrick Oppmann and his team have been on the ground. They've been speaking with people. There are so many stories of people who have loved ones who are missing or people who have love one that they saw pass during the storm and there just hasn't been a chance yet for the officials there to get a true sense of how many lives were lost. The sun is shining there this morning, not here but in the Bahamas, yes, and we are hopeful rescue crews can get on the ground -- Alisyn.\",\n",
      "            \"John, the video from the Bahamas, from Abaco Island is just shock. There's not a single patch of land there that seems it's survived. Homes are ruined, cars are ruined and of course you've heard these heartbreaking stories of people who have lost their lives. And what Patrick Oppmann was saying where he was, he doesn't think the death toll has been counted there yet. So, obviously, we're waiting for crews to get there today and give us a real assessment of the damage that's happened there in the Bahamas and, of course, you're the lucky one. Even we're seeing you in the thick of it there, people in Daytona Beach are the lucky ones, and we're being told by all the watchers in Charleston, South Carolina, things are looking more dangerous this hour. So, we'll keep everybody focused on all of that. John, we'll be back to you in a moment. But we do have some other breaking news. Because there's been this raucous scene inside the British House of Commons this morning, that's where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced his opposition leaders after suffering a humiliating defeat during his first key Brexit vote. CNN's Nic Robertson has been watching all this for us. He's live in London. What's been happening today, Nic?\",\n",
      "            \"Alisyn, today is the prime minister's first question time for Boris Johnson, and it's been a trial by fire for him. He's come out punching, accusing the opposition currently moving to pass a law that will block his Brexit plans, that will block a no-deal Brexit and ask him to go to the European Union to ask for an extension for negotiations. He's come out firing saying, I'm making progress on my negotiations, accusing the opposition of essentially writing up what he calls a surrender bill, surrendering to the European Union. He said if this bill is passed it essentially prevents him from negotiating properly with the European Union because he can no longer threaten them with a no deal. This bill is going to very likely be passed into law later today. It's very likely to be passed because we saw that vote last night where Boris Johnson lost by. END\"\n",

Then, shark scare -- will you go in the water knowing this out there? Meet the people who dared to take a dip and came face-to-face with a mouthful of daggers. They survived and they're here to share their death-defying stories next on LARRY KING LIVE. I'm Jim Moret from \\\"INSIDE EDITION\\\" sitting in tonight for Larry King. Our first guest is Nisha Kataria. She was a protege of Michael Jackson and lived at Neverland back in 2003. She's recorded a duet with Michael and is an artist in her own right, joining us tonight live from Atlanta. Nisha, thanks for joining us.\",\n",

And one day, they were sitting in Neverland, him and -- him and Michael. And he played Michael my \\\"I Will Always Love You\\\" song. And Michael said wow, who is this girl? Can you call her? And so the next thing you know, we drove to California to meet Michael. And I met him. The very first time I met him, he had a big smile on his face and he was very, very friendly and gave me a hug. And Prince and Paris and Grace, the nanny, were all in the room and they all gave me a hug.\",\n",

And they were about to shake my hand and Michael said, no, we don't shake hands in this family, we give hugs. So they all gave me a hug. And then Michael sat down and I sat down and we just started having a nice conversation. And then he told me -- he asked me if I could sing for him. And then I stood up and I asked him, Michael, what would you like to hear? And he said, \\\"Will you sing \\\"I Will Always Love You?\\\"\\\" And I sang him that acapella.

      "            \"Every morning when we would open our windows in our guest house, we would look at the lake. And there were two elephants being bathed in the lake. And there's music playing throughout the ranch, so you feel like you're in a movie. And there was actually a movie theater and everything you could ever dream of is at the ranch. It was just one of the best experiences of my life living there.\",\n",

And I actually -- the first time I actually really got to meet him was when -- the second time I sang for Michael. I sang, \\\"Because You Loved Me\\\" with my C.D. and Michael and his nephew Eli and Omar and Prince, they all came in and sat down. And Michael was like telling them, OK, listen. You have to hear her sing. And this was before I moved in. So I remember they were looking at each other and smiling as I was singing. And he was always smiling. A friendly boy.\",\n",
      "            \"I need to note for our audience, CNN has not been able to confirm Joe Jackson's assertion that Omar is, in fact, Michael Jackson's son. And according to news reports, Omar himself has denied any biological connection to Michael Jackson. Nisha, you mentioned Paris and Prince and Blanket. They -- Paris, I believe, was about six or five and Prince a year older, Blanket just a baby. Did you see them interact at all with Michael Jackson as a dad?\",\n",
      "            \"I did. You would think that these kids, you know, they -- they could have anything they ever wanted because Michael Jackson was their father. And there was one time when me and my mom and Michael and Prince were all in the movie theater. And there's a concession stand with all the candy and popcorn and ice cream you could ever ask for. And one day we were all in the theater and my mom offered Prince a candy bar. And Michael told her politely, he said, oh, can't have anymore today. He all -- you know, he already had some. So you could tell that they were disciplined kids and they were really close to their father -- really polite, friendly kids.\",\n",
      "            \"The world first saw Paris at Michael's memorial. And many people were surprised. She was almost elegant and very sweet and spoke from the heart. How did you find all three kids?\",\n",
      "            \"They're adorable kids. There was one incident when Grace was driving us from the movie theater back to the main house, because it's kind of -- a little bit far. And I was sitting in the front passenger seat and Paris and my mom were sitting in the back of the Lincoln Navigator. And Paris kept tapping on my shoulder and then hiding. And then I would look back at her and she was smiling and all embarrassed. And then I would, you know, sit normal again and she would tap me on the shoulder again. So she played like peek a boo games. She was just a cute, normal little kid.\",\n",

Instead of commuting from New Orleans to Baton Rouge for her job      with a mortgage company, she had only to walk several city blocks.  The      office building where she worked before Katrina reopened this week.  Mrs.      Zeller would gladly opt for a somewhat longer commute, a couple of miles      longer, if that meant moving back to her own house in New Orleans East at      number 40 Honeysuckle Lane.  Instead, she's living at the Doubletree      Hotel at the foot of Canal Street, her eighth temporary dwelling since      the flood.\",\n",

Back in September, we walked      around the Zeller home with her daughter.  Storm waters had left the      ground floor an unpleasant stew of mold and rot, and winds had caused      some exterior damage.\",\n",

And those checks come made out to you and      the mortgage companies.  And as I go in with, say, a contractor's      estimates, they give me a quarter or a third of that money, and that goes      on until you use it up.\",\n",

With their sophisticated ability to masquerade as taxpayers, they're beginning to try to figure out, can they, in effect, get access to the taxpayers previous tax return - because then they could file a false return that looks more logical and isn't as likely to be caught by our filters. At the same time, this is not an IRS problem alone, obviously. There are criminals hacking into systems all across the world, really. The goal they have is to get detailed individual information that allows them to commit fraud.\",\n",

We've all agreed that none of us by ourselves can stop this program and this problem. All of need to work together in a unified way for the first time, really, in history to protect taxpayers and protect their identities to the extent we can answer and certainly to protect their data.\",\n",

Our biggest problem is we're not hiring anybody at all virtually because the only way we can deal with the budget cuts we've over the last six years has been to not replace people when they leave, let alone hire new people. And that's because over 70 percent of our budget are people.\",\n",
      "            \"Last year, the IRS itself was a victim of a hack. One of its data systems was breached, and more than 700,000 taxpayer accounts may have been compromised. How has this contributed to problems this year going forward?\",\n",
      "            \"Basic taxpayer information was not breached or obtained. That was an application that allowed taxpayers to authenticate themselves and get copies of prior year tax returns. They had already stolen enough data, Social Security numbers, name and other identifiers that they could masquerade as the taxpayers. And what they were after was, if they could get last year's tax return, we'd be less likely to stop this year's fraudulent return. The net result of that is we have, of course, notified all the taxpayers and marked all of those accounts so that we think the amount of actual refunds paid out is relatively modest. But it was a serious representation of the sophistication of the enemy that we're dealing with, so we have - took that application down a year ago, and we are working at improving significantly the authorization required to get into any of those applications.\",\n",

He is in South Korea for the Asia Pacific Economic Summit. The president and his host, South Korean President Roh, issuing a joint declaration just a few hours ago expressing continued \\\"steady development\\\" in the U.S./South Korean alliance. But this trip isn't without any controversy. Some 250 demonstrators gathered early this morning to protest the presidential visit and the economic summit. The Patriot Act is being renewed. There are some changes. The FBI won't have as many subpoena powers and the Justice Department will have to fully report requests when it tries to gather information on ordinary citizens. Congress could vote on the revised act this week. Supreme Court Nominee Samuel Alito making the rounds on Capitol Hill today. Alito met Wednesday with Maine's Senator Olympia Snowe, who is an abortions rights supporter. She called their meeting constructive. Earlier this week, a 1985 memo was released in which Alito apparently said the Constitution did not contain a right it abortion. Democrats have voiced concern over Alito's nomination. His confirmation hearings are set for January. And, I should say, he was making the rounds yesterday on Wednesday. She was called a symbol of the government's slow response to Hurricane Katrina. The 91-year-old woman's body was covered and left outside the New Orleans Convention Center for days. More than two months later, Ethel Freeman (ph) has been laid to rest. Freeman's son had filed a lawsuit against FEMA in connection with that death. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin is in Washington looking for more money to help rebuild his city's levee system. The mayor led a bus full of city officials to some of the hardest hit areas early this week. He's asking for more funding to help New Orleans rebuilding and recovery efforts. Nagin is set to meet with House Majority Leader Congressman Nancy Pelosi. And check out this scene in Hollywood, Florida. A car stuck in a 15 foot sink hole. You see it there. It seems a water main in the area busted, swallowed up the car. We're happy to say, though, that the driver is fine.

So I think the vice president is right about that. But I think you need to then emphasize that people, as the president did, that people have the right to criticize whether we should have gone in. In other words, would he have used those weapons. I think people have a right to criticize the conduct of war. We never should have disbanded the Army, the police or the border patrol. We shouldn't have allowed for the looting. We probably should have had more troops there. All of those are valid. And then it's valid, it seems to me, as to how long we should be there. All of that. But to say that the president purposely misrepresented what was the data I think is not fair.\",\n",

Hillary Clinton said that and voted that way. My two Democratic senators. And so it is a little off the charts to have folks who voted to go in all of a sudden try to rewrite that part of it. You know, the problem this administration has, though, is that they were going to restore honesty and integrity into the White House and they would be more believed if they were more outspoken about Scooter Libby and what he was purported to have done. And I think they've got themselves in this box because it seems to me loyalty trumps honesty and the truth in this White House.\",\n",
      "            \"Let me ask you a question. And my understanding is that, in the Clinton administration, while, in fact, it was believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, that was the argument for continuing the sanctions against him. But to a better point, your hear about the Silverman-Rob Commission and all these things I think to the American public are very confusing, more commissions, more investigation. Isn't the truth that the final word is not in? That it's unclear if, in fact, that bipartisan panel hasn't come back with the results?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, honestly, I don't know that. So that's the honest answer to your honest question. I just don't know. But what I do know is this, everyone believed Saddam had these weapons, including most Democrats. And most people voted for us to go in. And so it seems to me the debate should be, well, we're there, now how well was that conducted. Congress hasn't done proper legislative oversight. I've been there 10 times and I had to push back five of those 10 times.

We should have the administration justify what it's doing, be held accountable because every 90 days we'll find out whether we're on track or off track, then we can ask why. The administration has always had an exit policy. They don't want to talk about it because they had to change it so often. But we've always known what we wanted to do. We wanted to stand up their army, their police, their border patrol, get their democracy moving, and then pull back. But we will never be able to leave and feel comfortable about leaving for two reason. One, they need our air support.

Pope Benedict, in 1910, said that couples could use contraceptives if one of them was HIV positive, so the intention was not primarily birth control but really to prevent disease.

Abstinence is much more effective in preventing the spread of HIV; there's all sort of statistics that show that. So when they say it's a more complicated issue, I think that's what they had in mind because there's some evidence that when people use condoms the lack of caution goes down.\",\n",

Six central banks led by the U.S. Fed are pushing to provide liquidity to the global banking system. Europe's financial crisis has lead to a credit crunch. And the banks are in need of liquidity. Markets have surged after the move was announced. The critics say it does nothing to address the root causes of Europe's sovereign debt problems. Britain has ordered Iran to close its embassy in London and given Iranian diplomats 48 hours to leave the country. The orders follows Tuesday's storming of two British embassy compounds by students in Tehran, an assault that Britain says couldn't have happened without Iranian government consent. Iran denied that and called Britain's embassy shutdown hasty. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has begun a historic two day visit to Myanmar, one of the world's most isolated countries. Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to meet with the president and the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. She says she wants to see firsthand if Myanmar's political and economic reforms are sincere. The former Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo has arrived at the International Criminal Court in The Hague where he's set to make his first court appearance on Monday. Gbagbo is charged with four counts of crimes against humanity for his role in the post election violence that killed thousands of people earlier this year. Britain's public sector workers downed tools and picked up placards today and joined protests all over the country. It was a simple message to the British government, hands off our pensions. Some protesters who were part of the Occupy London movement stormed an office building in the city center and said they were doing it in support of the strike. Police say more than 40 demonstrators have been arrested in London. Many public sector workers say they're coping with the worst of Britain's austerity measures. The protests happened on the sidelines of what is expected to be one of the biggest strikes in the UK in years. 2 million workers, according to the Union walked off the jobs at schools, hospitals and airports. Britain's coalition government says the walk-out was a damp squid, in the words of the prime minister David Cameron. That's in a quarter of civil service joined him.

Quite simply, the government wants to see these workers pay more money towards their pensions and working longer, it's something that unions say will leave their members fundamentally worked off.\",\n",
      "            \"My lifestyle is -- has been extremely affected. Utility bills are going up. We have a mortgage to pay. And I have to look after my daughter. I think it's asking far too much of public sector workers to take pay freezes, to have our pensions reduced just so the government can sort out the deficit without taxing other parts of the economy.\",\n",
      "            \"I work in a college. And we have the government last year cut one of the main sources of support for students which was the education maintenance allowance and that means that we are getting people who cannot afford to come into college. I get students calling me up saying they don't have the bus fare.\",\n",
      "            \"Government officials say this pension pan is necessary, but the public -- the average public sector worker is living longer and therefore the current pension plan is becoming more and more expensive, that expense being borne by the average taxpayer here in the UK. Government officials say this is an expensive distraction from the negotiating process at a time when the UK economy can ill afford it. Union leaders say this is just clearly a manifestation over the overarching anger and frustration being felt by public sector workers in the UK today. Erin McLaughlin, CNN, London.\",\n",

And those bonuses don't show up in the hourly wage data we get in this monthly employment report. And some other forms of compensation don't show up in the hourly wages, either, like health benefits or retirement contributions, maybe a life insurance that your company helps you pay for. Many employers are offering those things instead of wage increases. And, in fact, some of those broader measures of total compensation have been rising faster than hourly wages.\",\n",

Well, the White House is feeling quite good about this past week, a week in which the president had to face some skeptical European allies; also, the skeptical Russian leader with many Europeans and Russians quite concerned that the U.S. president is trying to go it alone when it comes to contentious issues, such as building a missile defense system. Now, as for Mr. Bush, he was up bright and early this morning on this Father's Day, apparently going to church with his wife, Laura, not the video you're seeing there. But he was up, going to church this morning. And this after, really, the highlight of his trip, yesterday's meeting, his first face-to-face meeting, with Russian president Vladimir Putin. The president and Mr. Putin apparently developing an unusually warm relationship. Mr. Bush calling Mr. Putin someone who he found to be very straightforward and trustworthy. Now, as for this contentious issue, U.S. plans to try to amend or scrap the anti-ballistic missile treaty between the U.S. and Russia so that the U.S. can pursue a missile defense system. Well, Secretary of State Colin Powell said today that while the Russian president still views that treaty as the cornerstone of arms control, he did show a willingness to discuss the issue further with the Americans.\",\n",
      "            \"They want to talk about it. They want to hear. They want to listen. They want to see more. They want to know about what we have in mind. And so I think there are opportunities to move forward. But, are they holding to their position? Yes. Are we holding to our position, that it's time to move forward? Yes. And now we have to begin the dialogue between these two nations.\",\n",
      "            \"And that dialogue will include Secretary Powell and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, having conversations with their counterparts in Russia. Also, Mr. Bush has invited Mr. Putin for another summit, this one this fall at his Texas ranch in Crawford. Mr. Putin reciprocating, inviting the U.S. leader to make a trip to Russia as well. Now, besides Russia, the U.S. president definitely had to deal with some concerns from European allies during his trip, many Europeans quite concerned that U.S. plans to build a system that would basically attack any income ballistic missiles, to knock them down, would fuel an international arms race in space. The president, meeting with the other members of NATO in Belgium earlier this week. U.S. officials, though, coming out of those meetings saying there appears to be a new receptivity to the president's proposal, pointing to countries such as Italy and Poland and Hungary, who seem to think this is the right way to go. Still, though, many countries, such as France and Germany, are still skeptical and somewhat critical. Also, overall, Europeans still very, very concerned about Mr. Bush's plans when it comes to another issue, his rejection of the international treaty to deal with global warming, the president saying that the science is not there. Again, though, Brian, the big challenge for this president, again, is to make sure to the Europeans that he's not just listening, but that he's taking their views into account -- Brian.\",\n",

This 15-year-old boy has died of a highly contagious disease -- disease though that doesn't have to be deadly. On Monday morning, his parents brought him to Sean Penn's relief camp in Port-au-Prince. He was dangerously ill. He'd been sick for days with a sore throat. What he actually had was diphtheria. It's highly contagious. He needed an antitoxin to survive. It's stockpiled in America but as Penn's team learned searching the city, no one could locate the treatment Penn called Dr. Sanjay Gupta. The CDC got involved and managed to turn up a few doses. The whole search had taken 11 straight hours. In the end, it wasn't enough, the boy died last night. And without vaccinations and medications, thousands more could be at risk. We're \\\"Keeping Them Honest\\\" tonight. Earlier, I spoke with Sean Penn, founder of the J/P Haitian Relief Organization and CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\",\n",
      "            \"Sean, you went around for hours trying to get aid groups to help. What was the problem?\",\n",
      "            \"In our very few automobiles, we were taking this boy from hospital to hospital, and we have had in each hospital, he was re- diagnosed with diphtheria, which would have been the first confirmed case. We also were simultaneously searching for the immunoglobulin that would have saved his life. That took 11 hours. And we spoke to the American Red Cross, General Trombitas, whose job is not -- the commanding general -- Major General of the U.S. forces here, spent hours himself, as did the Red Cross, trying to find this immunoglobulin. We spoke to every hospital that we've been dealing with and we dealt with nearly every hospital in Port-au-Prince over these last, almost four months. This is one of the fives things we're inoculated for when we come here. So, this is not -- should not be a surprise. Now, I have been -- my last time speaking to Sanjay, I've been trying to exercise some restraint. I know this is a very complicated situation. And there are great people -- Giovanni Cassani (ph), for example, at ILM. There are people who are working very hard in all of these agencies, there's no question. But it is dominated by an inertia that killed a 15-year-old named Oreo Lampeter (ph) today. This is a situation where nobody can say that this was any surprise. Diphtheria, we get inoculated for it. And we did not have anywhere in Port-au-Prince until we were able to find a couple of CDC people, Lauren Lambert, Ezra Barslay (ph), and then Kim Mong (ph) and Michael Copenstein (ph) at Pomets (ph), and they were willing to meet us late at night in an abandoned warehouse area where they keep -- which is the only place that have it. But none of these agencies had notified any of the major hospitals. When we finally got him to General Hospital, then we went off and we finally got the immunoglobulin. It got in too late\",\n",
      "            \"Sanjay, what do you make of this? I mean the fact something like diphtheria which they claim they're going to start vaccinating for -- the UNICEF says they have a whole program. They're going to start vaccinating on the ground as well as for other things which they don't currently vaccinate for. The fact that you couldn't find the medicine to treat this little boy, what do you make of it?\",\n",
      "            \"It's a preventable, stupid death, just like you said at the beginning. In fairness, even before the earthquake, only about half the country received vaccines. But Anderson, you know, if someone died of diphtheria the way that Sean just described in the United States, we would be reporting it, you know, because it would be such a rare thing to be happening. People receive this vaccine. It is just something we take for granted. And it prevents people dying a death like the awful one that Sean just described. This boy went in with a scratchy throat six days ago, and now he's dead. I mean, that's -- that's exactly what can happen here. I think what's particularly shocking when Sean called me or contacted me, I was looking at my Blackberry, just sort of horrified by the whole thing, is that even at various stages along the progression of this boy's illness, he could have been saved. He could have been saved. Certain medications, the anti-toxin that Sean was talking about; those things can help. And they're widely available in most countries on the planet. But despite the fact that right now people are more at risk for these contagious diseases in Haiti and in Port-au-Prince in particular, they can't even prevent the diseases from happening, let alone treat them after they do. So it was just absolutely shocking.\",\n",
      "            \"Sean, when you see this kind of thing up close, firsthand -- I mean where do you go from here? What needs to change on the ground now? What do people in America need to know? What can they do?\",\n",
      "            \"Listen, I was in the back of an open door SUV with this boy trying to get from hospital to hospital all day that day. And he was animated and alive like any 15-year-old, though he had oxygen in our truck. This is the first confirmed case of diphtheria post quake. It's a 15- year-old boy. He's dead. He was in school with his schoolmates before he was reported sick. There's an investigation going on. This is exactly the kind of thing that can kill masses of people. This cold chain has to be established. We've got to have the power for our refrigeration, it's got to be refrigerated; it comes from all other countries. And all these other countries and all these donors that are rebuilding Haiti, they've got to immediately make that designated disaster fund available and make it work now. And then when it comes to rebuilding, countries have to say I'll do the rebuilding of houses. I'll build the agriculture up. It can't -- it can't be pledges that don't happen or we're going to create a devastation that will be brought on America's hands that we don't have to do. And you well know, the United States military came here. This was one of the proudest moments that any American could ever have. They -- they were the primary force behind the life saving that happened, helping the government of Haiti that was so fractured and the people of Haiti. Now we've got to get people out of these ad hoc camps where these kind of diseases can spread so quickly. Again, this disaster has to stay on people's mind as waiting to happen. And there will be no excuse, and there's no excuse for the loss of this boy. No excuse.\",\n",

If you're building a floor, the Constitution is the base of our industry, right, of our country, of our company. Would you build a trapdoor that if you mess up and you accidentally something happens, you fall, and you end up next to the Unabomber?

Not that he doesn't have the right to say what he wants to say, right? Help him. Help him. Don't double down on it. If I ever got close to doing that even before I came on television -- first of all, nobody would let me go on television in this studio, anyone that I know. They'd have my back. They'd say, Don, I don't think you're right yet. I remember when my sister passed, nobody would let me go on television until they felt that I was OK. So if you care about him, really do, and not just the fame, not just the celebrity, not just whatever, then maybe some people are just too close to the forest. Can't see the forest for the trees. So, I'm trying to be, say something nice about Kanye, and I'm trying to actually tell the people who know him and who are close to him to help him. He's talking about the 13th amendment and trapdoors and hydrogen planes, and that's fine. But is it the appropriate venue? Is that what you want your loved one -- is that what you want your loved one's legacy to be, is to be the person who went into the Oval Office and said a whole lot of things that didn't make sense and then said, M.F. in the Oval Office? Is that what you -- OK. So the president is exploiting Kanye. This is as much his fault, maybe more, than Kanye's because he is the president of the United States. He gave him the platform. He invited the cameras in, and then he let it roll out live for everybody to see. He is taking advantage of a man who needs help, and I'm not being disparaging about Kanye. There are many people in this country who have mental health issues. He admittedly says that he does, and so we should take the stigma off and be honest about it and talk about it, OK?

Get him out. Try not to hurt him. If you do, I'll defend you in court. Don't worry about it. Part of the problem and part of the reason it takes so long is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore.

And even Stephen Miller's third grade teacher claiming that as a child, he had weird personal habits like eating glue. Come on. There are plenty of reasons to criticize Stephen Miller for his policies, like the forced family separations at the border, the policy that put children in cages. We don't need to go back to what he did or didn't do in the third grade. But this is where we are right now. Our politics are ugly and getting uglier. We just suffered through a bruising battle that put Justice Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, and now we're less than a month away from what may be the most important midterm elections in our lifetimes.

You saw people already beginning to file in and making their way to their seats. Now over the course ever this service, it is going to be a private ceremony and just for family and invited guests as well. Guests that really span from the political world in regard to Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who, of course, is here in Texas. And the mayor, Sylvester Turner, even all the way to boxers like Floyd Mayweather and the family itself. It will be limited to about 500 guests or so. Then after these proceedings are over, George Floyd's body will be transported by the Houston Police Department to the final resting place in Pearland, Texas. The final mile of that procession will be led by horse-drawn carriage and people can line the streets and give their final sendoffs as he makes the way towards his final burial spot, as we understand, next to his mother, the very same mother he cried out for in his final moment that we saw play out under the knee of a police officer a little over two weeks ago to the day. While the family, the city and more continue to mourn the death of George Floyd, the movement that his death sparked, created is as alive as ever and plays out in policy debates and movements and protests across this country -- Kate?\",\n",
      "            \"Omar is on the ground in Houston for us. We'll be getting into that as soon as the service begins in just a few minutes. Omar, thank you. So George Floyd's death and the massive protests that have followed have put a sharp spotlight on racial injustice and police brutality in the country. It's also reignited the debate over what the job of police should be and shouldn't be. Here is what a police chief of Sacramento told us here yesterday.\",\n",
      "            \"There's a lot of mental health calls that police officers don't need to be there. But nobody knows how who to call other than us. There's no other resources that can come and deal with the situation, so the fallback is police officers. I think one of the ways we can get a lot better is that we get the people that are best suited to respond to some of these things to go there as opposed to police officers.\",\n",
      "            \"Chief Hahn there echoing a sentiment that seems to be shared by police activists and politicians, aside. We heard Rashad Robinson talk about this at the top of the show. One alternative model that's now getting new attention now is based in Eugene, Oregon. The city has a different way to handle noncriminal calls with an organization known as CAHOOTS, which stands for Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Streets. It dispatches teams specially trained and specialized in mental health as first responders. Joining me is Ebony Morgan, a crisis intervention worker with CAHOOTS. Ebony, thank you for being here. For folks, and myself, explain a little bit more about what you all do.\",\n",
      "            \"Thank you so much for having us. Right out of the gate, I just want to send my condolences and from the team of CAHOOTS to George Floyd's family. As someone whose father died in a police encounter, I want to be sincere about that. CAHOOTS, as a team, has been around for about 30 years. We are made up of a medic and a crisis worker. We are dispatched through the city but through the dispatchers and we respond to noncriminal calls. We did 20 percent of the calls in the area last year, 24,000 calls. We can do welfare checks, death notifications, transport people to necessary services. A great thing about it is that, out of the 24,000 calls, only 150 of them did we wind up needing to ask for police to assist us. So we can show up on the scene and assess the need and the appropriate interventions that will genuinely help our clientele.\",\n",
      "            \"Ebony, why -- why does this system work? I have read that you all handle almost like 20 percent of the entire like public safety call volume for your area. Why does this work? What is it?\",\n",
      "            \"I think our greatest tool is the trust of our community. And then we are as strong as our community resources so from our perspective prevention and humanistic approaches are what really is effective. When people see us coming, they know we're there to help. That's the whole goal. We lead with the question: How can I support you today and figure out what the root of the issue is? How did you get here? What do you need to get to a place where you can thrive? And what if someone is in a crisis just addressing it to a degree to feel seen and heard to de-escalate by itself.\",\n",
      "            \"So I find it fascinating and important to point out as you mentioned you do call in police if that situation is required so there's work with the police in your community when need be. But looking at the model, Ebony, CAHOOTS, from what we all know, would not have been called to respond to the situation that led to George Floyd's death. So I say that to point out this isn't a cure-all for all the problems and longstanding and systemic issues discussing here. Why is this though -- could this be a part of the solution of reforming policing in America?\",\n",
      "            \"Absolutely. I think that since it's a systemic issue, the response and the resolution will also have to be systemic and need community supports and more unarmed mediation and decriminalization and a sense of restorative justice and truly mental health care nationwide to get to a place where we need less of that response. And then also in that system, as it's reformed I think there's a place for trained crisis personnel to respond and assess the scene and figure out the appropriate response. If it's outside of the scope we can call for an ambulance, call for backup police. But those initial eyes and objectivity, we have a lens that is not coming from -- we are not armed. We carry the tools to assist. So we approach with a really -- as objective as we could be of a lens to make sure that we use the right tools to help the person that we're visiting.\",\n",
      "            \"Ebony, thank you for what you do. This is around for 30 years and looks like it could be an important thing for folks and around the country to look at, the work you do, the care you give, and the trust you have with your community. Thank you, Ebony.\",\n",

North Carolina, Biden winning big Sanders with a few pockets out here. Look how big it is. South Carolina was Saturday. But you move it across here. Tennessee, a big Biden win. Alabama, a bigger Biden win. Arkansas, a Biden win and the shock of shocks last night, Oklahoma and then Texas Biden blue all through. Pop it back out. Also Minnesota, Amy Klobuchar dropped out, and, bam, Joe Biden wins Minnesota. Bernie Sanders is - did win Colorado, Utah and is leading this important we're still counting delegates, Sanders with a comfortable lead right now in California with 54 percent reporting. It takes a while to count the votes out there. But look at all the Biden blue stunning and shocking do not do the past 100 hours justice. Biden's giant win in South Carolina that was on Saturday, sent Tom Steyer from the race then Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. Buttigieg and Klobuchar then popped in Texas along with Beto O'Rourke to sound the alarm against Bernie Sanders and to lead a moderate rally around Biden Movement. Sanders in his call for political revolution often associated right with passion far more than anyone who chooses the label moderate. But look at this map and think again record high turnout for example in Virginia. The map and the numbers behind it speak for themselves. The candidate who woke up this past Saturday with no wins, little money and a weak national organization today has 10 wins, lead in Maine and money pouring in and now the promise of help from Bloomberg and the massive talented network of offices and staff he is now financing already from coast-to-coast.\",\n",
      "            \"Even before Bloomberg added the wow, Biden knew it was a Super Tuesday.\",\n",
      "            \"They don't call it Super Tuesday for nothing. We knew when you got to Super Tuesday it would be over. Well, it may be over for the other guy! Tell that to the folks in Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Minnesota! I'm here to report we are very much alive!\",\n",
      "            \"With me to share their reporting and their insights, this important day in politics, CNN's Dana Bash CNN's Jeff Zeleny Molly Ball with \\\"Times\\\" and Seung Min Kim with \\\"The Washington Post\\\" Raise your hand if you had Joe Biden winning 9 and maybe 10 of the 14 states on Super Tuesday. There are no hands raised at the table. You know you say that in the sense that sure, we knew South Carolina was going to help Joe Biden. Wow. The question is now with Bloomberg endorsing we haven't seen the details yet but the suggestion is Bloomberg saying I will not walk away from the fight, suggesting he will get financial help and the infrastructure help we have a different race today than we had yesterday and certainly than we had 96, 100 hours ago.\",\n",
      "            \"Absolutely. And I think it's important to remember that what change was the voter? You had a Democratic Electorate that was shopping around and shopping around in all of these states that's why the polls were in such turbulence that's why we didn't know until yesterday that Biden would be able to get this amount of support on Super Tuesday. There were a lot of late deciders and they were looking for a signal from their leaders, from the so-called party establishment, from elected officials in the Democratic Party and political professionals, and from the candidates themselves looking for any sign. All we have been hearing talking to Democratic Primary voters for the past year is just please give us someone we can rally around because we want to get straight to the point where we're running against Donald Trump.\",\n",
      "            \"And now, you have this moment where Bloomberg is on board following Mayor Buttigieg, following Senator Klobuchar, following Beto O'Rourke. You have a rally around now Bernie Sanders will say the billionaires and the establishment are rallying around Joe Biden but Joe Biden will wake up in California today. He is up already, he is tweeting in California today in a world he has never been in. He can call himself the front runner if he wants.\",\n",
      "            \"No one has ever been in a world like this.\",\n",
      "            \"Right, I mean the last 100 hours, I mean we went through Trump in 2016, I remember the Ross Perot Race in 1992, campaigns are always wild but this is wow.\",\n",
      "            \"So I just pulled this up because I wanted to get this quote right. I talked to a senior Bloomberg aide this morning, the Bloomberg now former campaign was the only one doing real data and analytics on this. And this source said that they Biden's rise coming in the data but nothing like what ended up happening. And that the polls in the data were moving so fast that they almost couldn't catch up. It was genuinely organic and a movement that nobody had ever seen before to the point where they said 12 hour polls weren't holding.\",\n",
      "            \"It was as if a switch flipped in the sense, people were talking on Friday, are polls that show Bernie Sanders within 2 or 5 in South Carolina. Are those right is Bernie Sanders is going to maybe win or at least come close to Joe Biden in South Carolina, would Joe Biden be done? Look what happened February 25th the South Carolina debate, Bloomberg's second bad debate a defining moment there. Congressman Jim Clyburn endorsed Joe Biden the next day and Biden had a CNN Town Hall with a very emotional moment where he talked to a pastor whose wife was killed in that Church shooting. Saturday he wins South Carolina win is a wrong word it was a blowout and I think that was sort of the word the 30 point blowout there. And then Monday, you get Buttigieg, Klobuchar and O'Rourke jumping on board. Super Tuesday, then Wednesday we lived. The volatility of the last 100 hours should remind us there could be volatility in the next hundred hours or in the next six weeks. But we live in this very moment in a very different race.\",\n",
      "            \"No question and you know for all the money in the world which Mike Bloomberg essentially has, it can't buy momentum. And that is what changed at the very end of this race. Joe Biden didn't have the wherewithal did not have the campaign structure. He was well-known though and well liked. Not any candidate I don't think would have been able to step in this position. It is Joe Biden. So we now are back to what this race may be looked like a long time ago, Joe Biden versus Bernie Sanders. Elizabeth Warren still has some deciding to do but we know where this is going. So the question here is, I think the biggest take away of the night, Bernie Sanders ceiling, he has talked again and again about I am the one who expands the coalition. I am the one who can defeat President Trump. That has not come true in fact, the opposite. His ceiling was very clear. So that is a challenge for his campaign going forward. He has a very talented operation he has some dedicated core supporters. He does have a movement. We will see if he can grow that. But boy this race has clarified and that's also become uncertain in a respect. But Democrats still face the same decision. Which way do they want to go a revolution or backwards to an establishment? We still don't know the answer to that. But boy Joe Biden never could have imagined this in all his wildest dreams.\",\n",
      "            \"And so if you just look, before if you just go back and look, this is the delegates Biden, 53 before yesterday, when we woke up yesterday morning 382 and counting right now. We're still counting delegates, allocating delegates in a lot of states including Maine and California states we haven't called yet. Sanders ahead comfortably in California but it take a while to get through all of that. Sanders had 60 to start the day he now trails Joe Biden in delegates. Now again we're going to have several days of allocating delegates throughout the states we've already called is going to take us perhaps a week or so. So it's possible at the very end if California comes in good that Sanders could be slightly ahead of Biden. But the expectation was that Sanders could stretch it out on Super Tuesday. Here is another thing, and again this could change but Sanders likes to talk about the popular vote that he is winning at the grassroots level. At the moment, Joe Biden is not only leading in delegates, he is leading in votes cast for Democratic Candidates for President. Again the California numbers could change that. But on the morning after Super Tuesday, when Democrats in these states to come and we'll get to them later. Having a conversation, what should I do, could Joe Biden have asked for anything more than he has received in the past 96, 100 hours?\",\n",
      "            \"Everything has broken well so perfectly for Joe Biden for the last several of days. And I think right before the South Carolina Primary we were expecting a Joe Biden victory, but like you mentioned earlier probably a small margin. I don't know if anyone was quite expecting the nearly 30 point blowout that the Former Vice President enjoyed on Saturday night. And I found looking at some of the exit polling some of the numbers that I found fascinating were if you look at the people who were the late deciders, who decided who their votes were in the last couple of days Joe Biden won those voters by more than 30 percent. So a lot these voters I'm sure some of the early voters may have some regrets right now but if you look at the late deciders they saw the late momentum coming, they saw the party coalesce which the Republicans did not do at this point in 2016. This is a guy that we're putting our faith in to beat Donald Trump in November.\",\n",
      "            \"And to your point, they would look for someone who could beat Trump and so they looked for over the summer, they were looking Elizabeth Warren. There has been times they're looking at Bernie Sanders and they still are. Senator Sanders still a force in this race. Bloomberg got a look, rose up in the polls in a lot of those states then had to - I'm sorry Mr. Mayor horrific debate that just brought him back down-to-earth. So my question now is let's be honest Biden has weaknesses in his campaign. There are questions about his candidacy, however, the question is, can they now capitalize on the moment they have? The money is pouring in Bloomberg is offering to help with of this potential infrastructure. There are legal questions there you have to do a Super Pac or something to make it happen. But the just exchange this morning Bloomberg getting out of the race, and look it's tough whatever your opinion of Mayor Bloomberg or any politician you get into a race, you invest heavily in a race. It's tough to get out and concede, he says I've always believed at defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it. After yesterday's vote it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American Joe Biden. Today, I've had a chance to work with Joe, on the issues over the years fought for working people, in his own life. Today I'm glad to endorse him. And I will work to make him the next President of the United States. The \\\"I will work\\\" part is very important. Now as we go forward the question is does the Biden team will they bring in the right people? To say, okay we have been given a gift here, a second life. Now let's do the nuts and bolts we need to do to make it work?\",\n",
      "            \"That this is really the $64,000 question right now. How will the Biden Campaign restructure and retool organizationally with its fund- raising with a potential data operation in order to capitalize on this. That is obviously what Michael Bloomberg is trying to encourage him to do on a candidate level, as part of their discussion this morning, on a campaign level, it is really, really critical. What happened with Joe Biden is so unprecedented, that he rode these endorsements, which starting with Jim Clyburn into his now former competitors, Beta O'Rourke in Texas in a way that we've never seen endorsements matter before, really ever in the history of modern American politics. But his infrastructure, his organization is subpar. Even they would admit that.\",\n",
      "            \"And the question also, I've talked to a lot of Obama people who said that they have offered to help to try and restructure this campaign. That is the challenge facing them. Joe Biden has never been in this position before in his long life. So we'll see if his restructures. Money will help at times but basically he still has the same organization he had a week ago, which was a small one. So this is going to be a long fight for delegates. Look at the calendar some big prizes at the end as well, New York and other places. But for now, the calendar is favorable to Joe Biden with Missouri, Michigan, Florida coming up, Illinois and other places. So this is a clarifying moment. It's not over, we should caution. Let's watch this play out week by week. Remember the 2008 campaign, that long stretch where Obama had a huge collapse and Hillary Clinton rose, let's just--\",\n",
      "            \"And even right now, there are so many delegates we have yet to see allocated because the votes are still coming in, in California alone.\",\n",

There were 1344 last night we still have a lot to allocate. This will get better by the end of the day. But 276 in California 137 in Texas, 47 in Colorado and a lot of these states Joe Biden won. So you expect he is going to get more than his share.\",\n",
      "            \"But 276 out of 415. The majority of those go to Bernie Sanders it's even Steven on delegates.\",\n",

      "            \"We'll see how it goes as we go forward. When we come back, there is much more to talk about the map going forward and the states coming ahead and Elizabeth Warren's big decision. And if you look closely Bernie Sanders says he's the candidate bringing in a new Democratic coalition but a lot of Joe Biden's win mirror the map that made Nancy Pelosi Speaker.\",\n",
      "            \"More now on yesterday's giant Super Tuesday vote, the new opportunities it presents for Joe Biden, the challenge for Bernie Sanders and the tough decision now facing Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Here was the hardest thing for Elizabeth Warren on Super Tuesday, her home state of Massachusetts you bring it up here, in the Democratic Primary in her home state she got 22 percent of the vote when you round up. 22 percent of Democrats in her home state, all Elizabeth Warren could master Joe Biden winning Massachusetts with 33 percent Senator Sanders coming in second with 27 percent and Elizabeth Warren running third at home. You see a lot of Biden blue and very little Elizabeth Warren right out here Cambridge, Brookline right outside just outside of Boston the suburbs, near where she lives and where she taught at Harvard. But a lot of Biden blue, lot of Sanders when you move out here. Sanders had a big rally at here over the weekend. This big disappointment for Elizabeth Warren who was the growth stock candidate during the summer but wherever you look, you come over here, a giant Biden win in the state of Virginia Elizabeth Warren a distant third. Viability we talk about wins you also talk about delegates. This is the race about delegates. This was the hardest part for Senator Warren, in so many states falling below 15 percent meaning out of the delegate hunt. You move here to North Carolina, Senator Warren out of the delegate hunt. This goes on and on throughout the map. Places where her home state, where she was born, in Oklahoma, very disappointing, out of the delegate count.\",\n",
      "            \"So Warren has a very tough choice now and you could sense before the vote she knew this was coming.

      "            \"Prediction has been a terrible business, and the pundits have gotten it wrong over and over. So, here's my advice. Cast a vote that will make you proud. Cast a vote from your heart. And vote for the person you think will make the best President of the United States of America.\",\n",
      "            \"A lot of stunning things in this campaign, most importantly at the moment, the resurgence of Joe Biden. But if you go back and look at the summertime, the conversations we were having at this table over the summertime about the growth of Elizabeth Warren, to see what has happened to her is frankly stunning, and the home state part has to be, for her, embarrassing, as she talks to her staff today about a very difficult decision, do I go forward?\",\n",
      "            \"The home state is embarrassing also the fact of not reaching viability as many places as they thought. They thought Texas was a possibility and California a huge possibility. She still can be viable in some districts in California but not what they were thinking. They really had built this operation in California and all over the place. So it is a huge disappointment. She has a decision to make talking to her advisors it is not whether she has a path. She wanted to stay in it is the alternative to be on the stage with Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren to show America that hey, I'm a different person, a fresh face if you will. But those hopes are pretty much extinguished. Now not only does she get out and win it is her decision let's not force this, but who does she endorse?\",\n",
      "            \"yes.\",\n",
      "            \"Is it Bernie Sanders or is it Joe Biden like that is central question here? And we don't know the answer to it. It is a tough choice for her, I would say.\",\n",
      "            \"She stayed silent a long time in 2016 and got hammered for it.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, a couple of things. One is I'm hearing what you're hearing that right now the wrestling is who to endorse. The factors that go into that are of course ideologically, she support as lot of what Bernie Sanders does. Personally, a lot of Bernie Sanders people have been really awful to her. That is no small thing. On the flip side, you know she does - has positioned herself as the alternative to both. And so Joe Biden might be somebody she would support. I can tell you the Biden Campaign and people who are backing him are desperate for her not only not to back Bernie, but - Bernie Sanders but even if she gets out and endorses no one, that they think that's bad for Joe Biden, because maybe not all of her supporters would back Bernie Sanders but a healthy majority would. I just want to make one another quick point about Elizabeth Warren, the \\\"x-factor\\\" of going into for the past three days is what happens with Mike Warren. And part of the reason--\",\n",
      "            \"Mike Bloomberg.\",\n",
      "            \"--Mike Bloomberg, thank you. Part of the reason for that is Elizabeth Warren, because she took him out. She didn't even wait for him to get a breath in, in that first debate where he was on the stage and she completely chopped him off at the knees and he never recovered from that. That is a very big role that she played in the overall lance escape of this race.\",\n",
      "            \"And Joe Biden has a lot of thank you notes to write. You talk about Mayor Buttigieg, Senator Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke now Mike Bloomberg, he might want to put the Warren one on top of the pile when he is sitting down in the task.\",\n",
      "            \"Regardless of what she does.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, and I think the point of that is that this surge for Joe Biden wasn't something that Biden did, it something that happened to him. Almost none of these things were actually done by Joe Biden. He's not the one who had a bad debate for Mike Bloomberg or eve n really played a role in that. He is not the one, I mean, he did get Representative Clyburn's endorsement but that was obviously a huge factor that wasn't something that Biden himself did. His debate performances were steady but they didn't really improve. And we've been talking about what we were talking last summer, we were talking about the Warren and we were also talking about the surprising resilience of Joe Biden. The flip side of that though is that, despite having all these advantages on paper it took him until the very last minute to sort of put it away because of the weaknesses that voters could see and because of things like organization and fund-raising that have always been challenges for him. So I think the question moving forward is, now that this has happened to Joe Biden, can he do something with it? That's basically what we're all waiting to see.\",\n",
      "            \"And I'm fascinated by this moment because Sanders has some adjustments to make too. Sanders keeps saying I'm bringing in all these more young voters and this new coalition. The evidence is it's just not there it doesn't mean it can't be there - he is in Nevada, in Colorado and now in California he has proven growth with Latino voters and that is not something to underestimated and it is important constituency.\",\n",
      "            \"But you talked about white working class, Bernie Sanders says that's my wheelhouse, Biden wins Minnesota, Biden wins Oklahoma, Biden wins Massachusetts those are 80 percent or more white electorates. The flip side is Biden has a challenge, younger voters are not voting for Joe Biden and at least coastal Latinos are going for Senator Sanders more. So now you're in this adjustment where essentially we'll wait on Senator Warren and be respectful of that choice. Essentially though, if you're in Sanders camp or Biden's camp you're viewing this as a two-person race. What adjustments do you have to make as the map goes on.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, the thing going for - I mean, a lot of advantages were Bernie Sanders - according to the exit polls obviously with younger voters, but they tend to be less consistent voters. Biden has that advantage by having that advantage with older voters. Biden is certainly going to have to make a lot of adjustments. And I found Congressman Clyburn's comments this morning fascinating, certainly played that the king maker role in South Carolina but he was pretty blunt saying the campaign does need a shake-up here and I think Biden's campaign will take that very seriously in the next couple of weeks.\",\n",
      "            \"This - I'm sorry, go ahead.\",\n",
      "            \"I'm just curious to see what tone Biden takes going forward because Sanders is taking a very antagonistic stance trying to sharpen the contrast between them you know in order to make people choose ideologically. Does Biden engage in that and say no here is whey Bernie is wrong, or does he try to sort of extend an olive branch to the Sanders coalition, saying hey, young people on the left, it is okay you can come in and you can be part of this and we can all go forward together.\",\n",
      "            \"Sanders also out with a new Obama ad this morning saying, I supported Obama. We have to fact check that a little bit but that is fascinating development here.

This has to do with drama that's been unfolding really over the last 24 hours on Capitol Hill. It started at an Oversight Committee hearing. Darrell Issa chairs that. He had a confrontation with the ranking member, the highest ranking Democrat on that committee, Elijah Cummings. It was contentious, and it has continued overnight to today to what has just happened on the House floor. Let's bring in Joe Johns who joins us from right Washington now. Joe, bring us up to speed on these recent developments.\",\n",

What she did was she offered what's called a privileged resolution on the House floor, alleging that the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Darrel Issa, acted inappropriately in trying to turn off the microphones and trying to adjourn the meeting while Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland was raising objections to the way the committee was proceeding. And so, Marcia Fudge essentially read this privileged resolution. It doesn't have to be acted on immediately. And the bottom line is it's not likely to go very far because the House of Representatives, as you know, sort of operates as a place that is generated by brute force.\"\n",

Back at Guantanamo bay, officials from Qatar were on standby, waiting to take custody of the five Taliban detainees the U.S. was releasing in return for Bergdahl. That was the guarantee the Taliban needed to let the American soldier go after five years a prisoner. The Pentagon will not disclose if it was Navy SEALs or Army Delta Force teams. They were taking no chances. Several dozen of America's most elite forces were involved. Other troops stayed at a distance, plankton drones flew overhead keeping watch. The heavily armed U.S. troops landed facing 18 Taliban and Bergdahl. A senior U.S. official says Bowe Bergdahl was able to walk and they quickly got him on board the helicopter. Once in the air, an extraordinary moment. Bergdahl wrote down the letters \\\"SF?\\\", asking if these men were U.S. Special Forces.

And Beth Karas is outside of the Arias trial in Phoenix where she has been covering it for HLN`s \\\"AFTER DARK\\\" and for \\\"In Session.\\\" And ladies, we kick off our countdown. The No. 3 reason why Jodi may have snapped: she thought Travis was cheating on her. Jodi explaining on the witness stand why she thought that.\",\n",
      "            \"He was taking a nap one day, and he left his phone wedged between two cushions in the couch in the living room. He was in another bedroom sleeping, and I just figured -- I didn`t know if he was being honest with me. I had a feeling he wasn`t. I snatched it, and I went into the bathroom and shut the door. And I -- clicking around on his phone, he had a touch screen, it was a smartphone, and I didn`t really know how to use it, but I found the text messages and began to read them.\",\n",
      "            \"And without telling us what they said or based on those text messages and Mr. Alexander`s phone, you believed he was not being faithful with you?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes.\",\n",
      "            \"Not being faithful. All right, Sharon, so does it seem plausible to you that Travis cheating on her might have been one of the reasons she snapped, if in fact she did?\",\n",
      "            \"It very well could be. I mean, what we`ve seen with women, any -- any small factor or large factor -- it just depends on the woman -- could very well cause her to snap. If she was building to something, and this was the thing that set her off, it`s a complete possibility that infidelity would do it.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, the \\\"SHOWBIZ Newsline\\\" may give us clues by looking at the history of the relationship. We flash you back to September of 2006. This is when Jodi and Travis met at a legal convention in Las Vegas. It was in November when she converted to Travis`s faith and she became a Mormon. February 2007, the relationship becomes sexual. Now, that`s a problem for two devout unmarried Mormons. And four months later Jodi suspects Travis is cheating on her. Beth, you`ve been there every day. What do you think? Could that be one of the reasons Jodi may have snapped?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, I think it`s probably the primary reason that she ultimately snapped, but then according to the state, premeditated this, that she made the final decision. And what you just played of her on the stand, that`s when she got the evidence she suspected and then broke up with him a few months later. They officially ended their long-distance boyfriend-girlfriend relationship. And it`s after that that she moved to Mesa, Arizona, and they continued to have, really, a clandestine relationship that ended up in her killing him the following year.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, SHOWBIZ TONIGHT can tell you it wasn`t just Jodi suspecting that Travis was cheating on her that may have made her snap. This brings us to No. 2 on the SHOWBIZ countdown. It`s Jodi`s claim that Travis abused her. Now, of course, she told a very scary story about Travis` supposed violence streak during her trial. Let`s watch.\",\n",
      "            \"\\\"How can you call me selfish? I just lent you $700.\\\" And when I said that, he got angry and crossed the room, and he started shaking me. And he said, \\\"\",\n",
      "            \"I mean, obviously, every time we hear the picture that she paints is a very scary one, but so many people do think that Jodi is simply playing the \\\"I was abused\\\" card as an excuse for killing Travis. Of course, she`s not denying that she killed him, but she does claim it was in self-defense. Now Sharon, based on the stories that we`ve seen on your Oxygen show \\\"Snapped,\\\" can abuse like the type that Jodi claims actually be enough to cause her or someone to snap?\",\n",
      "            \"Absolutely. I think, honestly, abuse is the most common reason we see women snap. Especially someone that has done so many things to mold her life to fit his. She joined his religion. Then she violated that religion for him to keep him happy, and then he`s abusive to her. If all of that is true, then absolutely, that could very well be the thing that pushes her over the edge and sort of creates this momentum in her. And then keep in mind, too, this is a woman whose own parents say she`s mentally unstable.\",\n",
      "            \"Right.\",\n",
      "            \"So that`s another factor you have to put in there.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. And there`s one thing that nags at me and I think so many people about this case. It has to do with Jodi`s own mother telling investigators that she believed Jodi had these mental problems. Watch this.\",\n",
      "            \"Jodi has mental problems. Jodi would freak out all the time. She would call me in the morning all happy and call me an hour or two later in tears, crying and sobbing about something she didn`t want to talk about. And that happened constantly. And her friends saw it, too, and they -- I had one friend call me in the middle of the night, and he`s even called a hotline for bipolar people. He said Jodi is bipolar and she needs help. And that`s why we talked her into coming here so she could be around family.\",\n",
      "            \"Beth, to Sharon`s point, her own mother saying Jodi had mental problems. You pair that with these allegations of abuse, a recipe for someone to snap, in your eyes?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. But that is not the strategy the defense is using in this case. We often know more than the jury knows, and the jury doesn`t know this. They don`t know what Sandy Arias, her mother, has to say about Jodi being mentally unstable. Jodi herself said, oh, she had contemplated suicide, but no therapist who testified on her behalf has made any sort of diagnosis of even a personality disorder, let alone a more severe mental illness.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, from those abuse claims to No. 1 on our \\\"SHOWBIZ Countdown\\\" of reasons why Jodi Arias may have snapped: Jodi apparently not being able to move on after breaking up with Travis. Now, Travis` friend Mimi Hall, who discovered Travis dead in his apartment testified that Travis told her someone was stalking him, and he of course, thought it was Jodi.\",\n",
      "            \"You indicated that part of what he told you was that this stalker was a female, right?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes.\",\n",
      "            \"And what had the female done that he was warning you about?\",\n",
      "            \"She had...\",\n",
      "            \"Objection.\",\n",
      "            \"Overruled.\",\n",
      "            \"She had slashed his tires several times. She had slashed -- he had dated someone earlier that year. She had slashed her [SIC] tires. She had sent threatening e-mails to both Travis and his girlfriend at the time. She had followed us on the first date that we went on. And she\",\n",
      "            \"Well, there you have the testimony. But of course, Jodi denies that she was stalking Travis. Sharon, is there a very real connection between women who become obsessed and then snap?\",\n",
      "            \"Absolutely. I think part of that is that sort of blending of where they sort of lose that line of reality and they become so obsessed with this man. and they can`t seem to stop themselves and they stop making logical decisions. I think that`s where you end up on this road. I don`t think anybody expected her to do something this heinous, but it could certainly see how that would contribute.\",\n",
      "            \"And of course a stalker, I actually looked it up. It`s defined as someone who pursues, harasses, threatens, and is aggressive. So Beth, I mean, does this sound like Jodi to you and perhaps enough to make her snap?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, there are all kinds of accusations, allegations out there. The jury only knows about some of them. But the defense, interestingly, has kind of opened the door to it, and so now with the domestic violence expert this week being cross-examined, it is coming up. I mean, the jury is learning a little bit more, that Travis Alexander, for example, did fear Jodi Arias and her stalking.\",\n",
      "            \"And, Beth, proving whether or not Jodi snapped is, of course, critical to her not being sentenced to the death penalty...\",\n",
      "            \"Yes.\",\n",
      "            \"... because if she snaps, there goes her claim of self-defense, right?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, you know, the jury might believe that she was defending herself, but that you know, she -- it all happened so quickly, and this overkill was Jodi snapping. She`s defending herself. She kills him. But then she keeps stabbing him. And so the jury, if they believe that, and they might come back with second-degree murder. It might save her life. They may say, \\\"She didn`t go there, she didn`t premeditate this. She didn`t plan for a week to kill him. She basically snapped defending herself and then couldn`t stop killing him.\\\"\",\n",
      "            \"Sharon, based on everything that we have heard and seen of Jodi Arias, from all of the women you have profiled who have snapped, do you think Jodi did, in fact, snap?\",\n",
      "            \"I think it`s completely possible. I think it`s such a hard -- I mean, it`s such a subjective line. But honestly, I mean, as a person, I want to believe that she snapped, because otherwise, you have to believe that she did all of this on purpose.\",\n",
      "            \"Right.\",\n",
      "            \"Which makes her one of the most heinous female killers we`ve seen in a very, very long time.\",\n",
      "            \"No question about that. Sharon Martin, Beth Karas, thank you so much.

Snow, rain and high winds have snarled traffic on the highways and left thousands without a plane to catch. For some, things will be getting better for Thanksgiving for many of you, but millions more, it's going to get worse. Chad Myers is in the CNN Severe Weather Center. Chad, where is the storm headed and, potentially, how many people could be affected by it? Sounds like a lot.\",\n",

That's that number we focus on. 43 million will be traveling long distances. Here's what we've got. We have a tornado watch in Florida with the system as this cold air wraps in here. And making tornadoes on the ground. At least I know of one so far today. Heavy rain across the southeast and mid-Atlantic. And snow north of there. So that's how it happens today. This low is still developing. The low is somewhere right about there. And so what's going to happen for the next couple days. We'll bring under the warm moist air here. It's going to be a rain front for I-95, all rain. So if you're in New York, you go, hey, this storm's a bust, it didn't snow. We don't expect it to snow. The snow is north into parts of Ohio. I can move one more map farther up there. That's where it's snowing. Talking about I-80, the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the New York through way, all having snow on it right now. The problem will be when it starts to get to sunset. Nothing's going to be -- going to be melting anymore. It's going to be sliding. We'll get snow sticking to the ground and hopefully there will already be barrels of salt there when you get there. There are the plains. I'm not saying they're stopped, because they're not. There's 5,000 planes on that map. Ants on candy with this map, so many planes there. But many of them, I won't say most, but many can be delayed today because not going to get out of the gates on time. Here's Atlanta departures. All of these planes have come and departed.

The self-proclaimed interim president, Juan Guaido, tells \\\"The Washington Post\\\" that the opposition is in talks with sympathetic military officials to oust President Nicolas Maduro. Maduro is calling the political upheaval a U.S.-led coup. CNN'S Nick Paton Walsh went undercover inside Venezuela to capture the desperation that is gripping the nation. It could lead to political change. Nick joins us now with his exclusive report. He's live in neighboring Bogota, Colombia. Nick, tell us what you learned.\",\n",
      "            \"John, it is startling how we tend to cast the crisis in Venezuela as some big geopolitical new cold war -- battle of wills between Moscow and Washington. But really, for people inside, it's about food. It's about the startling mismanagement and corruption of the Nicolas Maduro government and how that's left people unable to get the daily things you and I take for granted -- water, dinner, breakfast. I should point out for your own technical note, many of the people we spoke to requested anonymity out of fear because of how we filmed. Some of the audio isn't the very best so don't adjust your set, but here is what the last week inside Venezuela looked like.\",\n",
      "            \"Cross into Venezuela's unending disaster -- the world's worst growing refugee crisis -- and it's like the world, as you know it, is slowly ending. Oil once made them the richest in South America but this is now the line, for three days and nights, to get a full tank. In the capital, there's a queue for everything, everywhere. Hunger breeds a special kind of anger.\",\n",

      "            \"There's no queuing for the youngest living off what, even here, nobody wants. This isn't play, it's practice for self-defense.\",\n",
      "            \"My brother got killed in July by another gang, says 14-year-old Uzmaria. They found the body in the river. We gather stuff, we beg. A piece of chicken skin to take home. And the socialistic utopia that now leaves nearly every stomach empty. This was the day when change was meant to come. Hundreds of thousands flooding central Caracas, watching opposition leader Juan Guaido swear himself in as interim president. But it fast turned sour. They've had this standoff outside the military airfield here for months but this is the first time with an opposition leader claiming the presidency. All eyes were on the army and whether it, too, would rise up.\",\n",
      "            \"This is the important question, really, in the standoff. It's about the military's vote. They may be throwing stones at them here, but what they really need is the army to switch sides.\",\n",
      "            \"That didn't happen and the police tear gas and motorcycle charges sent us fleeing down side streets. Some, likely, wounded, although dozens reported dead during the day. It was up here in normally loyal slums where the fight was nastiest. Special Forces entered these streets and they've been coming back to make arrests all during the afternoon when we're invited to meet Carolina's extended family where Maduro's base has long lived. State handouts bought their loyalty for years, but now this is all she has to feed four this day. And they say now they, too, want Maduro gone. \\\"We can't hold it in anymore,\\\" one of her cousins says. \\\"We're being crushed with beggars now, always begging. This isn't political, it's survival. People are killing each other for a kilo of rice -- for water.\\\" Army defectors outside Venezuela called on soldiers to rise up, but we hear from one junior officer that even when you can't feed your family, it's more complicated. \\\"I would say 80 percent of soldiers are against the government -- some even go to demonstrations. But the big fishes -- the senior officers are the ones eating, getting rich -- while on the bottom, we have it hard. I get a dollar and half every month promptly -- enough for one chicken and a food box from the barracks. And then we have to work magic to make it last, like everyone else.\\\"\",\n",
      "            \"Would you or the soldiers you know at your level -- would you open fire on resistance people in the streets? \\\"I'd rather quit. That person could be my brother or my mother. We need a general to flip -- to make a change.\\\" And, as Washington says Maduro isn't president, but Moscow insists he is, everyone else walks zombielike, further and closer towards starvation.\",\n",
      "            \"Now, just a reality check here. I mean, a lot of people cast this as a constant unending crisis. People have been dealing with these economic problems for years. I've never seen them quite so ghastly. But you should bear in mind you don't see daily mass street protests. That large one you saw in that report -- people went home quite fast. And so, that internal momentum for immediate protest-led change isn't quite there at the moment -- John, Alisyn.\",\n",
      "            \"Nick, we saw you inside that grocery store there. How are people in Venezuela getting the food they need?\",\n",
      "            \"This is what is so unbelievably baffling. I mean, the infrastructure of that country still sparkles. It was one of the richest in the region, frankly, just a decade or so ago. And now, it's remarkable. You know, we bought ourselves, as we arrived, $200 worth of groceries and that was a ridiculous amount. It was like eight bottles of water, some ham, some cheese, some nuts, some fruit. And that in itself, next month in the local currency, will be worth twice as much. As we said there, things have a self-fulfilling way of becoming more expensive because everyone thinks that tomorrow everything is going to be worth less. Now, just imagine that -- $200 for massively overpriced food -- so much more than it was when I was there 18 months ago. It really is a daily crisis for people. And one of the ways the Maduro government seems to keep itself in power is the handouts of food boxes every month. You heard that soldier in the barracks. That's how people seem to make ends meet. And then you, really, so many others rummaging through trash -- something that you and I would consider unconceivable. So common wherever we saw there. I mean, even ourselves, on a limited budget -- we found it often quite hard to get food. And that is so staggeringly the reason why people are so furious right now -- John.\",\n",
      "            \"And, Nick, we heard one of the people that you interviewed say we need a general to flip. And so, what are the chances that the military would turn against Maduro?\",\n",
      "            \"This is the big question. As it currently stands -- and we saw a lot of this in -- you hear lots from the rank and file that they're angry and they go through the same problems all Venezuelans go through. But there's the richest that seem to keep the generals and the higher ranks in power there. And so long as that is all secure and as long as those generals manage to keep their subordinates on the leash so to speak, it's very hard to imagine how we'll suddenly see the military defect. And without that, it's also hard to see how Maduro gets kicked out. And we see Juan Guaido there -- a charismatic figure -- selling a message of hope to the people, many of them middle-class as well. But he doesn't, it seems, represent those in the slums you saw there, too. They have their own set poverty base to fight. And so, we're in for months of problems here, potentially, rather than some sudden swift change in power. Back to you.\",\n",
      "            \"Nick Paton Walsh, thank you so much for the reporting. I mean, John and I report on this every day but until we saw your pictures and what the kids there and the parents are resorting to, I think that I wasn't able to get my head fully around what's going on in Venezuela. Thank you very much, Nick. Well, the government shutdown here ended only after planes at a New York -- at New York's LaGuardia Airport were grounded. So up next, flight attendants and air traffic controllers tell us how the shutdown is still jeopardizing safety.\"\n",

We can anticipate it will start somewhere just about two weeks from this past Sunday, but no official date given from the Vatican yet today. However, the crowds continue to be the story again today.

Blair is seeking a third straight term in office. U.S. and Iraqi troops clashing with Iraqi insurgents. The U.S. military says the battle was ongoing in a remote area northeast of Baghdad. At least two American soldiers and one Iraqi soldier were killed. In the meantime, two car bombs exploded around the same time in separate cities, killing at least two people, including one U.S. soldier. Six others were injured. U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is urging Congress to renew the Patriot Act. The attorney general will defend the law before a Senate committee two hours from now. The Patriot Act gives officials more power to monitor and prosecute suspected terrorists and their aides, but critics also say the law is too intrusive. Without renewal, some of its provisions will expire in December. All the excitement you could ask for in a championship game. The University of North Carolina getting out to a big lead over Illinois Monday night in the final game of the NCAA tournament. The Fighting Illini managed to tie the game late in the game, but in the end, UNC holds on, scoring the final 5 points to win 75-70. This is UNC's first title since 1993 in the Dean Smith era, and the first for Coach Roy Williams, who is the coach now of UNC, who took four Kansas teams to the Final Four, but he never won it all. But he has his trophy now, doesn't he? Officials in New Jersey are waiting for word on whether flood- ravaged parts of the state will be declared federal disaster areas. More than 3,000 people have now been evacuated. Acting Governor Richard Cody says property damage from the weekend storm could approach $30 million.

One of the leading candidates is this man, Cardinal Francis Arinze. He's a Nigerian cardinal. The church is growing by leaps and bounds in developing nations of Africa, Asia and South America. The question this morning is this: Is the world ready for a non- European pope? Bob in New York writes: \\\"The world was taken by surprise 26 years ago, and this generation is aware of that moment. So, I think that the world would not be surprised if a non-Italian, perhaps non- Caucasian, is selected.\\\" D.W. in California: \\\"I would think so, once it's pointed out to the world that Jesus was not European.\\\" Joe writes: \\\"It's time for the Catholic Church to have a non- European pope. This would make the church a more global entity, reaching out to all of the people of the world.\\\" Kevin writes: \\\"The world needs an American pope to finally deal with and resolve the sexual abuse crisis in the church. Pope John Paul II had the opportunity to deal with it and did not.\\\" And David in New Brunswick writes: \\\"I think the world is more than ready for a non-European pope.

His English, while technically perfect, was difficult to understand, because it was a very thick Polish accent.

When you don't have food for a baby, it's not a good story. When you have to pull people down from their buildings because you're not -- I'm sorry but that's really upsets me and frustrates me.

      "            \"Elaine Duke is now in San Juan, Puerto Rico. These are CNN's exclusive pictures of her briefing on the plane in route there. Later this hour, she will hold a press conference which we are going to bring you live when it happens. We have CNN teams on the ground to bring you the real story in real time. It can be summed up in three words. People are suffering. Sick patients are getting worse with the lack of medical care. Millions of people are still without drinking water. Food is running out. There are shortages of gas, cars are lined up for miles trying get it. And one of the most frustrating aspects, thousands of containers filled with supplies are sitting at the port of San Juan. I want to begin with CNN Correspondent Boris Sanchez. He is on the ground in San Juan. So, Boris, you've been there several days now. Have you seen any improvement in the distribution of aid?\",\n",
      "            \"Brianna, incrementally. So far here at this gas station we're standing in San Juan, we have seen the line starting to move steadily. But it is a massive line, Brianna. It is blocks long. At one point, we counted more than 100 cars. And at about 5:00 a.m. when we arrived, I actually got a chance to chat with the guy that was in the front of the line. He told me that he got here at 9:00 p.m. last night. The gas station ran out of gas so he just parked his car and went to sleep, waiting until it would finally open. If you look over here to my right, you see people lined up with gas canisters. Some of them with many gas canisters to try to take this home and power their generators. We've seen people using all kinds of containers to pump -- to put gas into, including paint canisters, old jugs of laundry detergent. They are really scraping by. And it's not just gas that they're lacking. I spoke to one woman that was in line this morning who told me that she had spent several hours in line outside a grocery store yesterday. And when she finally got inside, she was heartbroken because there wasn't any water. There wasn't the food that she was looking for. There's a lot of desperation here. I was chatting with one man who asked me, where is Donald Trump? Where's the federal government? Where's the military? They are not feeling the aid here. And to make matters worse, Brianna, there is rain in the forecast for Puerto Rico. The ground is already saturated. And in some neighborhoods, flooding is a serious issue, even without a hurricane. We were in one neighborhood yesterday. There a channel going through it and it often floods during a regular rain storm. during Hurricane Maria, there was sewage going into homes. A lot of people in that neighborhood are homeless because their roofs have been blown off. They are now going to have to find shelter as we hear there are now two to three days of rain ahead for Puerto Rico -- Brianna.\",\n",
      "            \"All right, Boris, stand by for us. As you keep an eye on things here in San Juan, we're going to keep you close. Acting Homeland Security secretary, Elaine Duke, just responded to the San Juan mayor's criticism. You'll remember the San Juan mayor saying, damn it, this is not a good news story. Here is what Elaine Duke said after landing in San Juan.\",\n",
      "            \"The end of my statement about good news was it was good news that the Puerto Rico, the many public services of the United States and the governor or Puerto Rico are working together. And I do believe that that is the way -- part of the way we believe. And it is nice to see the communities together trying to recover and support each other.\",\n",

      "            \"Certainly a tough time and a tough job that you all have ahead of you here. I want, though, about your boss's explanation there because she said this was about people working together. But that's not what she said. She had said that it was a good news story, quote, \\\"in terms of our ability to reach people.\\\"\",\n",
      "            \"So I understand the frustration of the people on the ground that are not necessarily getting the supplies or seeing people. But they do need to know that there are 10s of thousands of federal government employees, to include U.S. military personnel that are in Puerto Rico in the water and in the air actually above them as well working hard. I know that we've had teams that have reached every single municipality on the island and we will keep doing that. So, again, we certainly understand the frustration. But I think what the acting secretary, again, was trying to convey is people are working hard 24 hours a day. There is no shortage of concern about the situation there or for the people of Puerto Rico. And we're hard at work and we're going to stay hard at work until we get power turned on, until we get clean water to people, until people can move back into their homes and until kids can go back to school.\",\n",

So, I mean, it's pretty desperate where folks are. And I -- you heard Boris' there from San Juan. And we should certainly keep in mind that this is -- this is San Juan, right, this is the major city. So, you get farther away, you get into the mountains, you get away from the big city. You get to Vieques; it's a different, worse, more desperate situation. When he said that looking at aid being handed out, it seems to be very incremental. That's the word from the ground. So, what's your response to that?\",\n",
      "            \"So, again, it -- this is not something that people that are in desperate circumstances like to hear. But given the devastation, given the circumstances, it's going to take time to make sure that that aid gets distributed. As you said, lots of things in San Juan. The capital, the port is open there. But moving things from the port into the farthest reaches. We're doing airlifts to try to do that because of the damage to the roads. Actually, the Department of Agriculture has Forest Service teams that are called chainsaw teams that are literally there cutting trees and limbs to try to open passage. I know that there are 11 major roadways in Puerto Rico that have now been open. Again, people don't want to hear that it's going to take time, but they should know that the federal government is doing as much as we can, as quickly as we can to get aid to people wherever they are.\",\n",
      "            \"I think one of the big concerns, and we saw this after Katrina too, is does the federal government have grasp of just how bad this is, of how bad what's happening there on the ground in Puerto Rico is? According to Puerto Rico's emergency Web site, they say 34 hospitals are up and running. We heard from Tom Bossert yesterday, a somewhat similar number. I want you to listen, though, to what Dr. Sanjay Gupta with CNN told Anderson Cooper last night.\",\n",
      "            \"If you give a hospital fuel for the next six hours, are they really considered up and running? Yes, technically they are. They have power. The problem is that imagine trying to run a hospital like that, if you're running out of fuel, if you're running out of water. Hospital are buildings that cannot function at all without power. You can't put in a suture. You can't get an electronic medical record. You can't give a dose of insulin. You need power for everything. So, it there's not a consistent source of that, it's not really a hospital that's up and running. It's not a hospital that's going to take new patients. It may meet the criteria, but it's not really doing the service for the people who need it.\",\n",
      "            \"Does the federal government have a grasp of which hospitals are up and running and really what that means for them? Does that mean that --\",\n",
      "            \"Right.\",\n",
      "            \"-- they have power. Does that mean that they're an hour away from running out of water which actually would obviously impede a lot of medical care. Is there a grasp of that, sort of, molecular level. Here's where the big issues are. Here is where it is very acute with this medical care in this part of Puerto Rico?\",\n",
      "            \"I think it' fair to say that we do. Again, it's a very incremental approach so you're going to have hospital that maybe yesterday had three hours of power.\",\n",
      "            \"How are you in touch -- how are you in touch to know?\",\n",
      "            \"So, it's having teams on the ground. Because, again, the infrastructure has been damaged. The communication architecture has been damaged so much that it's difficult to get communication. So, we're putting people on the ground physically at those hospitals.\",\n",
      "            \"With staff phones to be in touch.\",\n",
      "            \"Exactly. And, in fact, I had heard, too, that Marines are going out in teams with communications to be able to facilitate that kind of discussion and getting the word passed.\",\n",

      "            \"Right.\",\n",

So, this is, sort of, in a more official role than just someone who's in their neighborhood, as so many thousands of people are dealing with that quite as well. But, obviously, a hospital is an acute situation. Does that give you concern that there are not people there yet at these hospitals, providing that essential communications channel so that you really know how dire it is?\",\n",
      "            \"So, again, I think that there are people at the hospitals, not all of them. There are still a number of hospitals that have not been able to reopen for various reasons. We're working incrementally through that. We have people on the ground. We -- again, our priority is life saving and life sustaining. And certainly, hospitals are a huge part of that. So, that's one of the top priorities of the Department of Homeland Security and all of our federal partners as we go through this.\",\n",

We appreciate you taking the time Now, the secretary of Health and Human Services is on some pretty shaky ground. His fate is up in the air right now. And President Trump is considering whether to fire him, whether to fire Tom Price because of high flying and expensive travel. Price says he's going to pay for his part of the charter flights. But that's just a small fraction of the costs. Here's what he said about his future within the Trump administration and his response to the controversy.\",\n",
      "            \"We think it's important to do a number of things. One is to say there will be no private air charters at HHS going forward. Now, second is to cooperate fully, obviously, with the inspector general. There is a review going on. And then, I called for an internal review within the department itself. And then, finally, to pay for my portion of those trips. This is unprecedented. Never been done, to our understanding, before by a secretary, in spite of the fact that previous administration about secretaries that flew an awful lot. I work at the pleasure of the president. The president is a remarkable leader. I'm incredibly privileged to serve in his cabinet and work on behalf of the American people. And I look forward to gaining -- regaining the trust that the American people -- some of the American people may have lost in the activities that I took.

      "            \"I don't think we know. I mean, I think it's too hard to read President Trump reliably on something like this. He's had kind of a lower threshold to fire people. He made it very clear, he's very transparent about how irritated he was with Price on this. I think the answers from Price, the justification has fallen way short. But he seems to me to be on a -- in the middle of an effort to rehabilitate himself that must be encouraged by the president. But he may look and see how much heat there still is and decide that wasn't enough.\",\n",

Their first response was inadequate and, sort of, I know we follow all the regulations and he had to do this because he had to meet with the American people. He didn't want to meet -- risk missing a commercial flight, right. So, I think they've had a -- done a terrible job handling this. I was talking to a conservative radio host about this to get a sense of how callers are reacting. He said people are calling in and calling him a swamp rat.

Ordinarily in administrations you would have people lining up to replace somebody like this. You could draw from Republican governors, Democratic governors if it was a Democratic administration. The problem with this administration is, you might not be able to find someone who would replace him. And that's what Gloria Borger is hinting at. It might give them, you know, kind of cover and say, oh, you know, kind of turn the page on health care. Is that really going to make health care any easier if they get somebody new in there? So, you know, we'll see what they end up doing. It's Friday. Maybe we'll get a news dump at some point.\",\n",

Listen, when Ivanka Trump flew to Germany, she flew commercial. That doesn't look good when the president's daughter, who arguably is more high profile, it flying commercial and he Health and Human Services secretary is flying on these military jets that cost $500,000.

He knows that he has to make his case to these New Hampshire voters. It's a fickle set of voters, no question about it. And his family has a bit of a mixed history here. His father won the New Hampshire primary in 1988. His brother got second place in the New Hampshire primary in 2000. So Jeb Bush enters this race here with all of that in mind. But as you said, he takes question after question after question. I would say it was polite and enthusiastic applause but he knows this is just the very, very beginning of this process.\",\n",
      "            \"He's working, he's really working to try to reintroduce himself and the polls show he needs to do that. You got outside of this event because, with Jeb Bush comes controversy with the family name. You spoke with some protesters. What did they tell you?\",\n",

And several signs that says, you know, Bush and Clinton, we need something new. I they is to be expected but, Brianna, one thing is clear from his first town meeting, he had no confrontations inside this town meeting. He answered all the questions. He had an interesting exchange about the pope, actually. He's somewhat of a new catholic in the second part of his life. He was baptized into the Catholic Church and someone asked him if he agreed with the pope's upcoming message on climate change and he sort of in a comment that was reminiscent of John F. Kennedy said he does not take his orders from the Vatican. He praised the pope as a strong leader but he said he would not take his orders from the Vatican. But overall, I have to say, Brianna, he was met with here enthusiastic applause and his meeting was not interrupted. He had no immigration confrontations or anything like that.

Michelle proved once again that she is an exceptionally brilliant and beautiful woman. However, both of those speeches were purely emotional in their appeal. I love this man. You can trust this man, the American dream. What Bill Clinton now has to do is actually make a policy argument. Why is it that Barack Obama's policies have worked or haven't worked as fast as they should have? And that's hard, because Bill Clinton made some very different choices. He famously declared the era of big government is over. He famously cut the capital gains tax. He famously triangulated.

He's got an ad running, oh, the Republicans want to go about the deregulation, you are part of the problem, sir.

CNN's investigative unit has been looking at this. And here with us now is correspondent Drew Griffin. Drew, this is very disturbing information.\",\n",

But what we've learned is that 117 of Southwest's Boeing 737s, in 2006, and/or in part of 2007, were flying in the air beyond deadlines for mandatory inspections. The planes, according to our sources at the FAA, and in Congress, said these planes should have been grounded, they weren't. And what's worse, according to these documents, again prepared by FAA and safety inspectors, for Congress, and obtained exclusively by CNN, is that the FAA managers knew the planes were flying beyond these mandatory inspections, and did not ground them, did nothing to stop them. That has at least one member of Congress outraged about this.\",\n",

Two of them involved crashes, and both of those crashes on the rudder system made it mandatory for these rudders to be routinely checked. Seventy of the Southwest planes were not checked for those rudders in a timely fashion and beyond the mandatory inspection limit. The other has to do with the actual fuselage or skin of the plane. That became a mandatory inspection way back in 1988 when an Aloha Airlines plane literally peeled off its top in mid-flight, taking one of the flight attendants with it. That when the Southwest planes -- and there were 47 of them flying beyond the mandatory inspection, when they were finally tested, the inspectors found six of those airlines had significant cracks in them. This is a serious issue. Southwest says that they thought they had dealt with this, they self-reported to the FAA, and they thought the matter was closed. The FAA's only response has been to the \\\"Wall Street Journal,\\\" which was that they believed that they have addressed all these safety concerns.

Let's go ahead now and bring in our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. And Sanjay, a special court has decided that Hannah's family deserves compensation, that they deserve monetary compensation. But what about this connection between vaccines and autism?\",\n",
      "            \"Right. That's sort of at the heart of this. And to be fair, the language they use is this was a \\\"concession.\\\" They conceded this case, as opposed to making a ruling, for example, saying that vaccines do cause autism. They're not saying that, necessarily. They're sort of conceding this case. I think an important point, for more of a legal standpoint. I think it's an interesting case. You have a girl who, at 18 months old at the time, receives all these shots. Two days later, within 48 hours, she starts to develop high fevers, inconsolable crying. Within months, she starts to regress in terms of walking, in terms of speaking, and is subsequently diagnosed with symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. There's about 5,000 cases right now in front of this vaccines court. This is one of them. And the court has said, \\\"You know what? There's enough here to sort of say we will -- we'll pay some of the money, pay a claim conceding the case.\\\" Now one thing that's important to point out, Brianna, is that this girl subsequently, as they -- as they cared for her, they found that she had the gene for a mitochondrial disorder. Mitochondria are these things within cells that sort of provide all the energy. And the question -- the reason they brought this up was, it was a question, could the vaccine somehow have worsened that condition and led to these symptoms of autism spectrum?\",\n",

It's going to set the landmark for all the rest of the cases.\\\" Some people will say, \\\"Look, this little girl was different, because she had the gene for this mitochondrial problem.\\\" And again, we've talked to folks at the Department of Health, and they're saying, again, this in no way says that -- that vaccines definitively cause autism.\",\n",
      "            \"So are there anything you -- are there any different things you can look into to see if a child should receive a vaccine? For instance, you said that this girl had a gene for mitochondrial disorder.\",\n",
      "            \"Right.\",\n",
      "            \"Can you check for that?\",\n",
      "            \"You know, you can. You can do genetic testing on all children before you give them vaccines. There's a couple of problems with that. First of all, it would be a lot of testing, No. 1. No. 2 is, we still don't know exactly what it is that we're testing for. We're not sure that there's an actual link here. We're not sure there's a link with other genetic disorders. So you know, if a child is completely healthy but carries the gene for something, does that automatically exclude them from receiving vaccinations? I think most doctors will say no and will point to the idea that vaccines still, you know, prevent a lot of diseases. So you know, let's not jump the gun here. But, you know, her father came out, who's a neurologist, and said, \\\"I think that this is an important case, a landmark case,\\\" because he thinks it may pave the road for a lot of other cases.\",\n",
      "            \"And you have so many families who suspect that vaccinations have played a role. So certainly at the very least this is going to add a lot of fuel to the fire there.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, you know, and I think it's worth pointing out that she is nine-years-old now. So when she received these vaccines, it was 7.5 years ago when thimerosol, the substance that you mentioned, the mercury preservative, was still in vaccines. It is not in most childhood vaccines today. So that is something to think about, as well. Although no one is saying for sure thimerosol causes autism either.\",\n",

And you said that in some ways it is definitely good that he has the benefit of time to try to figure out the best message and the best structure against whichever Democratic candidate he has -- he has to oppose for the fall campaign. And he also has time to unify the party behind him. But the other thing is today is actually very rare, because he pretty much has the campaign trail to himself. That is not going to happen very often. And one of the things that Senator McCain today even admitted to that's going to be a bit challenge, is staying in the narrative, staying in the storyline when you still have this clash of the titans on the Democratic side, where Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are still going at it and will be for quite some time, with anybody's guess who wins on that side. So it is going to be interesting to see Senator McCain try to stay in the headlines. Here's how he is going to do it, we're told. He is going to, first of all, later this month have a tour of what they're calling a biography tour, really try to re-introduce himself to the American people, to the voters, remind them who he is, his service in the military, his time as a prisoner of war during Vietnam, go to places that might really help to illustrate that. He's also going to give a series of policy speeches on some of the major issues. And also, he's going to traveling abroad, Don. That's going to happen, probably, later this month in order to try to bolster up that national security experience he thinks is really going to help him in the fall.\",\n",

      "            \"It's clear to me, and I know it is clear to you, the enemy remains active, deadly in its intent, and in the face of this danger the United States must never let down its guard. I thank Tom Ridge for being the first secretary of Department of Homeland Security. Good to see you again. Let me welcome members of my cabinet who have joined us, leadership team at the department. Appreciate the fact that a fine United States Senator and a great patriot has joined us today, Senator Joe Lieberman. Appreciate the members of the diplomat corps who have joined us. I appreciate the former DHS employees who are here. I appreciate all the current DHS employees for serving our country. And I want you to thank your families for the sacrifices you're making. I want to thank -- and I appreciate the homeland security partners from across the country who have joined us for this fifth anniversary. The events of September the 11th, 2001, demonstrated the threat of a new era. I say \\\"new,\\\" because we found that oceans which separated us from separate -- different continents no longer separate us from danger. We saw the cruelty of the terrorists and extremists, and we glimpsed the future they intend for us. In other words, there was some serious lessons on September the 11th that it's important for all Americans to remember. Two years ago Osama bin Laden warned the American people, quote, \\\"Operations are under preparation, and you will see them on your own ground once they are finished.\\\" All of us, particularly those charged with protecting the American people, need to take the words of this enemy very seriously. And I know you do. At this moment somewhere in the world, the terrorists are planning an attack on us. I know that's an inconvenient thought for some of you, but it is the truth, and the people in this hall understand that truth. We have no greater responsibility, no greater charge than to stop our enemies and to protect our fellow citizens, protect the American people. We are on the offense against the terrorists around the world. It is better to defeat them over there than to face them here in the United States. Since the enemy attacked us, since they declared war, since we responded, we've captured or killed hundreds of al Qaeda leaders and operatives in more than two dozen countries. With our allies we removed dangerous regimes in Iraq and Afghanistan that have harbored terrorists and threatened our people. Our men and women in uniform, those in the United States military, are helping people of those countries fight the terrorists and build free societies and secure the peace for their children and ours. We owe our military a debt of gratitude, and we owe them something more: we owe them all the tools necessary to do the job we expect of them. This war against these extremists and radicals who would do us harm is the great ideological struggle of our time. We're in a battle with evil men. I call them evil, because if you murder the innocent to achieve a political objective, you're evil. Those folks have beliefs. They despise freedom. They despise the right for people to worship an almighty in the way he or she sees fit. They desire to subject millions to their brutal rule. Our enemies oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear. They kill innocent men and women all the time. The only way these terrorists can recruit operatives, the only way they can convince somebody that their dim vision of the world is worth following, is to feed on hopelessness and despair. And so our policy is to oppose this hateful ideology by offering an alternative vision, one based upon freedom and liberty. Across the world America feeds the hungry. We fight disease. We fight tyranny. We promote the blessings of a free society. Not only because it's in our national interests, national security interests, but because it's in our moral interests. You see, by bringing the hope of freedom to these societies, we'll help peaceful people marginalize the extremists and eliminate conditions that feed radicalism. And so for the sake of our security, for the sake of the peace of our children, the United States of America will stay on the forefront of spreading freedom and liberty around the world. As we wage the struggle abroad, we're also building the institutions we need here at home to keep our country safe. Second part of the strategy is to protect the homeland. First part is to stay on the offense, bringing people to justice where we find them, spreads\",\n",

      "            \"So just moments ago, Pope Francis addressed the latest sexual abuse allegations, this as he's beginning his second day or his two- day, I should say, visit in Ireland, because right now he's visiting the presidential palace in Dublin. And this is the first part visit -- the first papal visit, I should say, to Ireland in nearly four decades at this point.\",\n",
      "            \"This trip comes at a very important time. The clerical sexual abuse survivors across the world are looking for answers from the Catholic Church.\",\n",
      "            \"We have (ph) the Pope the other day in a strong letter. A lot of it is good, but unfortunately he still says we're working on finding a way to hold people accountable. We're decades on. You can't still be working on it.\",\n",
      "            \"That's a strong summation of the frustration from some of the victims of this scandal. Joining us now from Dublin is CNN's senior Vatican analyst, John Allen. John, hello to you and what are we hearing, what are we expecting to hear from the Pope about this?\",\n",
      "            \"Morning, guys. Well, listen, I have been in Dublin all week covering the World Meeting of Families. That's a Vatican-sponsored gathering of Catholic families from all over the world, which is the official reason for Pope Francis' visit to Ireland. I will tell you that the mood here is clearly that people are expecting Pope Francis to tackle the clerical sexual abuse scandals in Catholicism head on and they're looking for something more than simply apologies and reassurances. They have heard those things from popes and other church officials before. They are looking for some concrete indication of what action Pope Francis intends to take, particularly on the issue of accountability, and accountability not just for the crime of child sexual abuse, but also for the cover-up of that crime by bishops and other senior officials. And so I would say that if Pope Francis does not deliver that, the disappointment here is going to be deep and it's going to be real, Victor and Christi.\",\n",
      "            \"You know, it's interesting because it was 1979 when Pope John Paul II made the last trip there and at that point, divorce, homosexual acts, and abortion were all illegal. Help us understand the atmosphere in which this pope is entering in Ireland there.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I mean, Ireland, as you say, is a vastly different country than the one that welcomed John Paul II in 1979. You have seen a fairly rapid process of secularization here. Mass attendance rates are down for the Catholic Church. Vocations to the Catholic priesthood are down. Nevertheless, the church does remain an enormously important social institution here. And you know, I mean, Pope Francis will draw warm and enthusiastic crowds. Tonight, in Croke Park here in Dublin ([ph]), he's going to celebrate a Festival of Families. You'll see some real enthusiasm there. Tomorrow, in Dublin's Phoenix Park, he will celebrate an open-air mass that is estimated to draw probably around 500,000 people. But that said, clearly the elephant in the room on this trip are those sexual abuse scandals. And of course, that would be true under any set of circumstances. Ireland has had arguably the deepest and most painful clerical abuse scandal anywhere in the world. But if you add in the recent context, that blistering grand jury report from Pennsylvania, identifying more than 300 predator priests and more than 1,000 child victims over a 70-year span, the horrific revelations we have seen coming out of the nation of Chile, the scandals involving former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick in the United States. In that context, it is absolutely unavoidable that Pope Francis is going to have to engage this issue, Victor and Christi early and often.\",\n",
      "            \"And engage with some of the victims. The Vatican confirmed that the pope would have this private meeting with some of the victims. Do we know how many? How this is going to play out?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, the Vatican has not released any details on that, which they generally don't in the run-up to these meetings. Remember, I mean, Popes have met sexual abuse victims before. The first time was actually in the United States when Pope Benedict XVI was there in 2008. Generally, it's a group of about six to eight, maybe 12 survivors. It will vary whether Pope Francis encounters them as a group or individually, sometimes both. The Vatican will not release any content from that meeting -- they don't even release still pictures or video, but the survivors are free themselves if they choose to, to discuss it with the media afterwards. And we will have to wait to see whether that happens this time. We are expecting that is likely to happen sometime today, perhaps this evening here in Dublin, so we will have to see how that plays out.\",\n",
      "            \"All right, John Allen, so good to have you here, thank you so much.\",\n",
      "            \"This morning, the Pope will be taking questions, we'll have more of that in our 10:00 hour.\",\n",

      "            \"In the coming weeks, that was one of just many aspects of Sen. Al Franken's resignation speech that struck me as unusual. If you listen carefully, he kept his foot ever so slightly wedged in the door. In fact, if instead, Sen. Franken had been making a speech, and announcing that he was staying and fighting instead of stepping down, he would've had to have changed maybe one sentence in the speech? There was no admission, there was no contrition. And who announces that they're resigning in the coming weeks? If you've done something so egregious that you're resigning your job, ya head for the door immediately. In fact, that's what Trent Franks did yesterday, and that's not what Al Franken is doing. He was trying to thread the needle of refusing to admit charges of his accusers, while not antagonizing them further. Franken's hand was forced by female Democratic colleagues, led by New York's Kirsten Gillibrand, who perhaps had their eyes on Tuesday's special Senate election in Alabama, and wanted to establish the moral high ground by ridding Washington of both Rep. John Conyers and Sen. Franken before Alabama voters cast their judgment on Roy Moore. Franken walked the plank. But maybe he had his fingers and toes crossed. He never admitted wrongdoing. He said he'd been anticipating an opportunity to defend himself before the Senate Ethics Committee.\",\n",

I said at the outset, that the Ethics Committee was the right venue for these allegations to be heard and investigated and evaluated on their merits -- that I was prepared to cooperate fully, and that I was confident in the outcome.\",\n",
      "            \"Don't misunderstand -- I am not saying that Franken is staying. If he leaves in a week or a month, it won't diminish my observation. I am saying that, when he spoke on Thursday, he sought to leave open the possibility that after Tuesday's vote, there might be some rethinking among his colleagues, perhaps with Moore getting elected, where Franken would then, say, hey, here's a guy against whom credible evidence exists that he assaulted a 14-year old, and he's about to be seated in the U.S. Senate, but I have to pack my bags? That doesn't seem right, he'll think. Joining me now, someone who was on CNN's \\\"NEW DAY\\\" with me yesterday morning, and called my analysis crazy --\",\n",

I mean, you're saying, \\\"Don't get me wrong; I don't think he's staying, but I'm not convinced he's leaving.\\\" And I'm also say -- going to say here that somebody better tell Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton what's going on here if Franken has his fingers and toes crossed, because Gov. Dayton is spending the weekend thinking about who's going to replace Sen. Franken.

Franken meant what he said, and as I said to you yesterday on \\\"NEW DAY,\\\" I take Sen. Franken at his word. I hear what you're saying. His reluctance is obvious.

They wanted to have Martin Luther King's dream, but they didn't want any discussion of his opposition to the war in Vietnam or to his struggle to end poverty in America.

The U.S. is transferring him today to Yemeni control. Is he being flown back to Yemen today and will serve the rest of his time in a Yemen jail. This may shock many Americans who will be absolutely dumb founded to find Osama bin Laden's driver is being released. Behind the scenes, this had been somewhat expected. He had been sentenced to a 66-month term over the summer and essentially time served. Essentially his time at Guantanamo Bay was going to run out by the end of the year. And the U.S. was looking, frankly, for somewhere to put him. It all started out that he was a terrorist mastermind. Well, now, not so much apparently. This is really being read inside the U.S. government as basically throwing their hands up, not really knowing what to do with him. They're sending him back to Yemen and it must be pointed out Yemen is a country that does not have a long- standing reputation of holding onto the terrorists it puts in jail -- Miles?\",\n",

If conventional wisdom holds, we can expect announcement sometime after Thanksgiving that Barack Obama is nominating Hillary Clinton to be his secretary of state. The culmination of what many believe was a carefully planned political courtship, very public, too. Joining us to talk more about that, Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons and Republican strategist and CNN political contributor Alex Castellanos. Good to have you both with us. Jamal, take us inside this decision. What do we know about this courtship? So much tension between the two camps and yet, somehow it appears this is now a fully baked announcement.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, there's a lot of reports about there being one-on-one conversations between these two leaders. The two of them talking on the cell phone really getting together. I know there's been some concern over at the transition office a lot of this was played out publicly, but I think all those people who were over there actually now thinking they trust President- Elect Obama's judgment on this. And that he really believes that Senator Clinton is going to be the best person to do this job and looking forward to making this all work. So these are small minor bumps in the road between the two of them or between the two camps but they think this is going to be a good relationship.\",\n",
      "            \"All right. That's one of the side of the spin. Alex, let's go to the other side of the spin. What I read on a lot of this is first of all they did it very publicly to make it difficult for Hillary Clinton to say no, and secondly in, putting Hillary Clinton sort of on the pay roll, if you will, it takes away a potential rival on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Do you go along with that strategy?\",\n",
      "            \"I'll tell you, I think right now Barack Obama is thinking long-term and not short term. He wants the Democratic Party not to have a Clinton and Obama wing. He wants it to be one Democratic Party run by the Obama administration. That's just basic politics. So yes, I think he's bringing her on board for that. There's real reasons for concern and differences on foreign policy. She supported the war in Iraq. And he didn't. She supported torture if necessary to protect the national interests, said she would obliterate Iran if it threatened Israel with nuclear weapons. She's been more of the hawkish wing. One thing we should credit her with, she has been able to sublimate her own political interests, for example, to keep Bill Clinton - make him president and keep him there. She is more than capable of doing the same thing to make him successful. Her interests are now aligned with his.\",\n",
      "            \"Let's keep in mind before we move off of this, Barack Obama's no dove. What he said was he opposed dumb wars, not all wars. So I think he and Hillary Clinton will find themselves in pretty good lock step when it comes time to deal with America's foreign policy.\",\n",
      "            \"So much has been said about this Lincoln \\\"Team of Rivals\\\" thing, the Doris Kearns Goodwin book and how Obama has been reading about Lincoln. The conventional wisdom is that he wants people who are going to challenge him. Jamal, how much can Hillary Clinton challenge Obama without raising the specter that there is some hard feelings there?\",\n",

      "            \"I'm sure not publicly, not if she wants to keep her job. But she has full rein to go into the president's office and call him directly to not have to go through intermediaries according to all these reports. Those are very important things for her to be able to do organizationally. So Obama is surrounding himself by pretty serious heavyweights. We saw the other appointments on the economic side with Tim Geithner and Larry Summers and the one that has DC buzzing, Melody Barnes who comes out of the Kennedy - chief council of the Kennedy Judiciary Committee and was the number two at the Center for American Progress. Melody is somebody who has been working with the Obama team. All these folks are people he is surrounding himself with who can actually help him out.\",\n",
      "            \"Let's go to you, Alex. The flipside of this team of rivals thing is that you have a fractious dysfunctional government. Is that a possibility here?\",\n",
      "            \"It may be. I would think Barack Obama is more of the FDR model. You hear so many stories about Barack Obama that advisors brief him and leave the room, not knowing exactly where he stands. He seems to be able to internalize advice and then make his own decisions. I think as long as he's giving someone like Clinton access so she can have input, she can voice dissenting opinion, for him, he's setting up the stage to be more successful than you might think. Getting a strong personality like that and sublimating her in the internal workings, if he unites the Democratic Party that way, that's a big political plus as well as a plus for statecraft.\",\n",
      "            \"Alex Castellanos, Jamal Simmons, thank you very much for your time. Appreciate it. Thousands will be watching when President-Elect Obama takes the oath of office in January. And untold numbers will be watching the thousands. We will look at the plans for protecting the president. And they are in a word extreme. But you know that. We'll give you details. When he assumes his new post, Obama will inherit an economy in transition. He introduced his economic team today. The Obama news conference still ahead in our next hour.

If all has gone on schedule and we are still awaiting the official word, Eileen Wuornos, who became known as the nation's first female serial killer, she'd be dead. She would have died at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time by lethal injection here in Starke, Florida, at the Florida state prison. Wuornos has been on death row for the past 10 years. Wuornos was convicted of killing six men that she picked up along Interstate 75. Police say she posed as a stranded motorist, picked up the men and then killed them and stole their belongings. She was an admitted prostitute. Wuornos had first said it was all in self- defense; but then after her first conviction, she recanted the story and said in fact that she did kill those men intentionally and robbed them for their belongings. Wuornos last night refused to eat her last meal, which was barbecued chicken. Prison officials say that she got up this morning about 5:30 a.m., she did read the Bible, but that no clergy were present today. She did not want clergy. If all has gone on schedule, she will have died in the electric chair. She was evaluated by psychiatrists a week or so ago, at the request of psychiatrists here, who said that perhaps she was not competent to face the execution. And in fact, that had been the case all along, people saying she's not competent for this execution. But in fact, though the evaluation turned out that those three psychiatrists said yes, in fact, she can be executed by lethal injection and Florida's governor Jeb Bush signed the death warrant at that point. And again, Eileen Wuornos at this point now, at 9:35 a.m. roughly, should be dead -- Paula.\",\n",

There are death penalty supporters, some death penalty opponents. But we talked to an attorney a little while ago who represented Eileen Wuornos for a short period of time, and he said the public's opinion of the death sentence these days, it's apathetic.

      "            \"That's right. We just learned so much just minutes ago. One thing is that one of the victims, a 70- year-old male, is currently right now in his second surgery. He had gunshot wounds to the torso to major organs. Initially went through his first surgery, now is in the midst of his second and is in critical condition. We also now have a firm, at this point, timeline of what exactly happened when. CNN has confirmed that at 9:49 was the final social media post of this suspect. He said many things, but one of the most poignant things he said was, \\\"I'm going in.\\\" And then, at 9:54, according to law enforcement, the call came in to dispatch. At 9:55, officers were dispatched. They arrived at the synagogue. The first officer went into the synagogue and met head on with the suspect, exchanging gunfire and he was injured. Now, what law enforcement just said minutes ago was even a more finite timeline than that. That at that point of time when the first officer, a Pittsburgh police officer, went in to engage the suspect, that the suspect had already we heard murdered, I'll say allegedly murdered, 11 people inside the synagogue. And that's when the exchange of gunfire. Then, the suspect went back into the synagogue, we understand, to try to actually take cover himself because he realized law enforcement was there. And it went on from there. Four law enforcement officers have been injured; 11 people in total are now deceased. There are two that are currently in critical condition, a 61-year-old female, the extremities to the soft tissue, along with the 70-year-old male. We also understand that there was one AK-47 that was found at the scene along with three assault rifles, along with three handguns. They will know more if all of those weapons were fired. Once they do, the crime scene investigation, which they are in midst of now. We want you to listen to the 911 dispatch call that CNN has obtained of what was going on in the amidst of it all. Listen.\",\n",

But it's so rare that we actually get a window insight to them actually doing this kind of an operation. And also, when you think about, they were in there. They were looking for someone who's now they believe is armed with this high-powered rifle. They're trying to rescue people. They're trying to get people out safely. They, themselves, are getting injured. And, really, you know, we have the motive right there. You know, they're saying this is what he's saying.

They provided situational awareness for responding officers to come in. Listen, this is a very dynamic situation for these guys. They know that there's someone in there that's actively killing. That patrol officer is walking around. He sees dead bodies in front of him. There's a physiological and psychological effect that law enforcement now has to train for to suppress that to -- because they have to go after the killer. That is their number one priority. So, the immediate responding officers that went in did a fantastic job. This is what law enforcement is training for every single day now, these active shooter mass shooting, you know, situations. It doesn't matter whether you're with, you know, federal law enforcement or a local municipality. This is the -- this is the threat environment that we live in now. And all law enforcement is being trained this way. And it's actually saving lives.

We do know, in talking to some of our law enforcement contacts, that he did have an active permit to carry in the state of Pennsylvania. He had illegal -- he had legally purchased weapons going back to 1996. The thing is we still don't know if the weapons that were used in this incident were weapons that were legally purchased. We have two separate things. We know he has purchased them legally. We don't know that these are the ones that he actually purchased legally. And the other thing is, in talking to law enforcement contacts, we haven't heard the fact that there was a high-powered rifle, like an AR-15, that was in his past as a purchase.

It`s interesting, isn`t it, that she didn`t have migraines when she was on the stand really under the scrutiny of the prosecution.

We`ve been talking about her having not just psychopathy, but a borderline quality, which is a narcissistic disorder and we think this -- all this behavior and, by the way, denial that she`s in serious trouble fits with these narcissistic spectrum problems, right? CHERYL ARUTT, PSY.D., FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGIST It does fit with those things, Dr. Drew. And do you think she`s loving every minute of this attention?

I remember he was telling me one of his memories was living underneath an actual cover on a truck port in the backyard somewhere and actually having visions of his mom literally going to the bathroom in a 5 gallon bucket.

And I think -- I was just talking to Stacey before we went on air, she`s already, for lack of a better -- I guess I`ll say this the best way I can, given the bird (ph) to Dr. Samuels. She wouldn`t acknowledge him when he walked back to the defense table. And now this expert witness, I saw them smile at each other at the beginning but her demeanor is changing. She seems to be a lot more brazen. She seems to be -- she`s talking with her attorney a lot more than she used to. She seems like maybe she`s realizing she`s getting to the nitty-gritty. So --\",\n",

      "            \"What a difference an A makes, or does it? We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. We're covering the breaking news. Wall Street spending yet another day in what's being described as freak out mode. You can see the Dow Jones Industrials down almost 300 points right now. The most apparent reason is the first ever downgrade of U.S. government credit by Standard & Poor's. One of the three main ratings firms. On Friday, S&P; dinged the rating of long term U.S. Treasury notes from AAA to AA Plus. And today it did the same to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the long suffering home loan agencies now fully owned by you and me, that would be the U.S. taxpayer. Just moments from now, President Obama is expected to address these matters from the White House. First, I want to share some details of what you might not necessarily be getting from all the dramatic headlines out there. The number one downsize of any credit downgrade is higher interest rates in line with perceived higher risk. But interest rates on U.S. Treasury bonds, right now, guess what, they're actually a little bit lower today than they were on Friday. Prices conversely are higher. Government debt still in demand. Stocks, as you know, are plunging. But in the year after Canada was downgraded in 1993, Canadian stocks rose more than 15 percent. Same with Japan in 1998. In Tokyo, the market actually rose 25 percent that year. And you may have heard the public scolding from China, quoting now, \\\"the U.S. has to re-establish the common sense principle that one should live within its means.\\\" Fair enough. But what's China's credit rating. It's AA minus. That would be two notches below AA Plus. We have reporters standing by, analysts standing by. Ali Velshi is in New York. John King is here in Washington. David Gergen. Let me bring in Brianna Keilar over at the White House first. Brianna, set the stage for us. This was a late addition to the president's schedule, 1:00 p.m., eight minutes or so from now. We expect to hear from the president. What was the thinking at the White House?\",\n",
      "            \"A late add, Wolf. And it's important to note, this is being billed by the White House not just as reaction to the downgrade by Standard & Poor's, but as general remarks about the economy. As we see the markets react, of course, to the downgrade, we see the worsening situation in the euro zone and concerns about how that will affect the U.S., expect President Obama to sound a reassuring note. To sort of be a consoler, if you will, and try to point to some areas of the U.S. economy that people should be somewhat optimistic by or at least reassured by. He will address, we expect, the downgrade, Wolf. And we saw this all weekend long from White House officials and surrogates of President Obama's, really slamming S&P; and attacking the credibility of S&P.; Also pointing a finger at House Republicans for the process that we saw, this chaotic process that led to the debt ceiling deal. Of course, that finger being pointed both ways there. And we're also expecting the president in a way to kind of capitalize on this message still, though, coming from S&P; and urging that bipartisan congressional commission to seize the moment and do what the White House, Wolf, calls a balanced approach to deficit reduction. That, of course, means adding tax increases, something that Republicans don't want to do, in addition to dealing with entitlements, something the Democrats don't want to do. Wolf.\",\n",
      "            \"Brianna Keilar, stand by. Donald Trump is actually joining us on the phone right now. Donald, thanks very much. What would you like to hear from the president on this historic, tumultuous day?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, it's been an amazing period of time, Wolf, when you look at what's going on in the country, to be thinking that Standard & Poor's, which I don't have great respect for because I watched their call on the mortgage market and on the housing market and they were 100 percent wrong on that and I don't know what they're trying to do by doing this, other than get some nice publicity for themselves, or to try and salvage their reputation. But to think that they would actually do what they did is absolutely incredible. And this would be a great time for the Republicans and the Democrats and the president to get together and really knock out something that would be good and really good for the country. I think it's a great opportunity to do something great for the country, meaning balance things out, balance the budgets, or at least close to balance the budget to put it in the Democratic term, but go out and do something really great for the country. Come back from your vacation and do the right thing. This would be a great -- this is a great opportunity.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, they do have a format. They have this so-called super committee, six Democrats and six Republicans. They're supposed to come up with a new plan by Thanksgiving. But the problem has been the Democrats really don't want to have major entitlement cuts, cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and the Republicans don't want to have an tax increases. How do you bridge that gap?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, that's true. And, you know, the other problem is, Thanksgiving, that's a long time away. This thing could be knocked out in two days if you had real leadership. You need leadership. And people can knock something out in two days. I heard about the wonderful committee, and then I hear Thanksgiving, and then it can be extended beyond that date and you almost say, what are they doing? Why can't they just do it now? And, you know, on your show and others, I've always heard that, you know, they were going to have $4 trillion in cuts. Trillion is a funny word because three years ago we -- you and I never heard of that word, and now it's the common word of choice, right? But they were going to have $4 trillion in cuts and now all of a sudden $4 trillion is not\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, you know\",\n",
      "            \"No, we used to do deal with billions.\",\n",
      "            \"Let me get back to that --\",\n",
      "            \"You and I, right, would do the show --\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, right.\",\n",
      "            \"And we'd talk billions, and now we talk trillions. We don't mention billions anymore.\",\n",
      "            \"Right. So let's talk a little bit about what would be important. You would -- would you like to hear the president say, I think you've eluded to this, you know what, Congress, you're in recess until September 7th. These are critical days right now. Get back to Washington and let's come up with some joint programs that the country can see to create jobs, to try to reassure investors out there. Is that what you want to see?\",\n",
      "            \"Absolutely I'd like to see that because, again, Thanksgiving's a long time off and I think it would be really a good sign. I think people should be called back and you work out a deal. If Standard & Poor's did one thing that was good, Wolf, it was that they should have been able to reunite the Republicans and the Democrats and the president on maybe getting a deal done, because it's an embarrassment to the country. I mean all over the world -- I'm getting calls from people in Europe, from people in Asia, they're saying, what's happening with your country? Who's running that country? They cannot even believe the things that are happening. As to -- well, of course, you look at the market and obviously the markets are down, you know, tremendously all over the world because of us. They're not because of something else, because of us. So -- but people are calling me, big people, and they're saying, you know, what's going on with your country? What's wrong? It is rather amazing.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. Well, you know, what's also amazing is this drop, what about 300 points, today. It comes on the heels of more than 1,000 points over the last few weeks. This has been pretty steady now, long before Standard & Poor's came out with their downgrade of the U.S. credit rate -- credit worthiness from AAA to AA Plus. You see 316 points down right now. Why does S&P;, which was, as you point out, wrong in failing to understand Lehman Brothers or AIG before the great recession, as it's called, why do they have such clout today?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I don't think they should have. And I've watched Mr. Beer and I've watched the gentlemen today on the show and different shows and I think they're having a good time going around talking about S&P.; I don't think they should be given credibility, Wolf, but they are given some credibility. And, you know, frankly, the country is not very credible right now. I mean we're not -- we're not being viewed upon -- if you look at what's going on when you want to invest, people tell you, oh, go to China. They want you to invest your money in China. You'll get a better return. You know, it's pretty sad what's going on. But S&P;, I think, frankly, you know, they shouldn't be given the kind of clout they're given. A lot of it is just tradition. They've been around a long time. But they've made so many bad calls that they should not be given the credibility that they are given.\",\n",
      "            \"What about this proposal that Mike Huckabee put out there, I'm sure you've heard it, that you would be a good secretary of the Treasury. Is that something you'd be interested in doing?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, you know, I just heard about it this morning. First of all, I respect him a lot. I think he's a great guy. And that's before the proposal. But I just heard about it this morning and, you know, one thing, you'd shake them up. I will tell you, I can tell you a couple of groups that wouldn't be too happy. OPEC wouldn't be too happy. China wouldn't be too happy. There would be some groups that would not be, because these are people that are ripping off this country like no one has ever ripped it off before. And I would tell you, Wolf, getting back to that, if the country ran well, if the country was prosperous, like China, like India, like others. I mean some of these countries are doing so well now, better than ever before by far, and on our back, if the country was doing well, all of these things as to entitlements and as to Social Security and all of the other things you're talking about would pale in comparison. I mean, they'd go away. But we have a country that's not doing well. It's doing much worse than people understand. We don't have our jobs. We don't have our manufacturing. You look at what's going on in China. We're rebuilding China. We are rebuilding China. We are rebuilding China. And they manipulate their currency, they make it almost impossible to compete because of that. It's unfair what they are doing, and they will make hundreds of billions of dollars of profit, let's use the word profit, on this country, on our country, and we have nobody that protects us. We have no leaders that go in there and protect. So, I'm honored by Mike's suggestion. I think he's a great guy. I think he would have done unbelievably well, and think he probably would have gotten the nomination had he decided to run. But you know, look, we do need somebody that will take our country back because we have lost -- or at best are losing our great country.\",\n",
      "            \"You have any regrets or any second thoughts about your decision? And I just want to point out, think about this for a second. It's the top of the hour, I want to alert our viewers in the United States and around the world that we're awaiting a statement from the president of the United States, he's going to be going into the diplomatic dining room there over at the state -- at the Whitehouse. As you can see, the president will be going to the podium there and making a statement. We are told it will be on the overall state of the U.S. economy, and the U.S. economy as well as on the tragedy of the death of the 30 American troops in Afghanistan over the weekend, 22 Navy S.E.A.L.s killed when that helicopter went down, the eastern part of Afghanistan. So, the president will be making a statement. We're now told, by the way, it has been delayed by a half an hour, so he's not going to be speaking until around 1:30 p.m. Eastern, about 30 minutes or so from now. We'll, of course, have live coverage here in the CNN NEWSROOM. We've got all our reporters, all our analysts standing by. We are continuing the conversation with Donald Trump, right? Donald, the decision you made a couple months ago not to seek the Republican presidential nomination. Any regrets?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, first of all, I want to say as I was listening to you very eloquently state about the president's conference, I was saying what a terrible time this is for our country. Our economy is absolutely doing horribly, the helicopter was just a disaster yesterday, what a tragedy that was. And you know, just what a -- what a terrible time it is for this country. This is -- things that you wouldn't have thought could have happened. I mean, what's going on with this country, and it's just bad news after bad news, the economy, the helicopter, you could just go story after story. Everything bad, nothing good, it's a terrible time. I have made a decision, as you know -- in fact I was watching a particular show called \\\"Meet the Press\\\" the day before I did this, and -- but by the time I made -- and I was leading in the polls with, actually, Mike Huckabee, the two of us were leading in the polls, but I made a decision for the reason that I made, however, I will tell you -- and I was happy with the decision, but if the economy continues to be bad, and it looks to me like it's getting worse and not better, and if the Republicans pick the wrong person, I would seriously consider doing it as an independent, and I think it's maybe time for that. Hopefully I won't have to because I love what I am doing, you know I love what I am doing and I'm having a good time and we're doing well. But if the economy continues to go the way it's going and if the Republicans pick the wrong candidate, I would certainly consider it, Wolf.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, who would be -- you know who the Republican candidates are out there, and presumably Rick Perry the governor of Texas is going to throw his hat in the ring, we assume fairly soon. Tell me who the right person would be, who the wrong person would be?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I know a lot of them and a lot of them have come to Trump Tower recently, Sarah Palin who is a terrific person and a friend of mine, she came in, and Michele Bachmann came in and she was great. I don't know Romney. I do know the governor of Texas, Rick Perry, who is a very interesting candidate, and I think he will prove to be a interesting candidate. But it's a little bit too early for me to speak up on that. I will have something to say about it in the future, but I really don't know Romney. I will tell you that I was very disappointed that Romney didn't interject or intercede in some form to get a better deal done in terms of the Republicans -- no really in terms of the country. And I was also amazed that here is the guy that is the leading contender, and he allowed this -- as you know, this renegotiation to go after the election instead of before the election, because if you had the renegotiation before the election, Obama could not have won, he just could not have won. We would have gone through the same thing as what we are going through now in six months or in nine months or in a year from now, before the election. So -- I mean, certainly, if you are running and if you are a leading candidate, you want to make sure this comes due. Now, that's not necessarily for the good of the country, it was for the good of getting re-elected, which would be for the good of the country.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, do you basically agree with President Obama that any long-term reduction in America's debt, the deficit spending, has to include what's called a balanced approach? Some entitlement cuts, cuts in spending for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, but at the same time, some -- eliminate -- some increased taxed revenue, or eliminating some of those loopholes, the subsidies the that's some of the big corporations get, or very wealthy. People like you, for example, get -- is the president right when he wants what's called that balanced approach?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, what I do think is this, the good economy solves all problems. It solves the ills of Medicare, which I would protect to the death, because I think it's very sad when they have to start playing with Medicare. I thought that when Congressman Ryan came up with a plan, I think a lot of Republicans are going to lose elections. He seemed -- right, wrong, indifferent, he should not have come up with that plan at that time. And you saw what happened in Buffalo, where a very popular Republican lost easily to a person that would have never beaten her without that plan. But the economy solves the problems. With that being said -- I will tell you, and I am a Republican, but with that being said, when the oil companies are making billions and billions and billions of dollars, and believe me, they are in cahoots with OPEC. There's no question in my mind that the oil companies are in total cahoots with OPEC. And OPEC -- and nobody, including China, has abused this country like OPEC. So, when the oil companies are getting subsidies, and when the oil companies are paying very little tax, I would say -- I would tax them and I would tax them very happy. That I can tell you.\",\n",

That's probably more than you make, Donald, $4.9 billion, and most of the income was taxed at 15 percent rather than the maximum 35 percent. Is that fair?\",\n",

We heard the explosions. A few seconds later, the soldiers started running around and said, \\\"Get in your vehicles, get in your vehicles!\\\" That means get in your tanks, get in your Bradley-fighting vehicles.

We sat for about 20 minutes. We heard no more explosions, and then there was the signal \\\"all clear.\\\" But for a while there, it was more than a little frightening, at least for some of the soldiers. Basically it was an inconvenience getting into those terrible chemical weapons suits in the desert heat. But we made it, and I should say that none of the soldiers in the U.S. 7th Calvary was injured in any way. Still not clear to us whether it was a conventional missile that was fired across or a missile with an unconventional warhead. But for the time being, everything appears to be smooth sailing, and the all clear has sounded. As I say, it was a good ways distance that the explosions were heard.

The next move for this unit will be when the order comes to cross the line of departure, which means go into Iraq and then head for our targets. That's our situation now.

Well, as the United States military now begins what will be its fifth year of war in Iraq, as you say, a milestone, more than 3,000 U.S. troops now having lost their lives in Iraq since the invasion in March of 2003. More than 111 U.S. troops losing their lives in the month of December 2006, the deadliest month of this year. This comes of course as President Bush is contemplating what the White House calls \\\"the way forward in Iraq.\\\" Contemplating a new strategy and the possibility of sending even more troops to the battle zone, boosting the levels from the current 134,000 U.S. troops on the front line. But of course, a good deal of concern that more troops might mean just more targets and as the Pentagon likes to remind us, each and every one of these people leaves a family behind. Don?\",\n",

Is the fourth annual poll that they have conducted and it shows 35 percent of service members polled say they approve of the way the president is handling the war, but 42 percent, the majority, disapprove. Only 41 percent of military members now say the U.S. should have gone to war in Iraq. That 41 percent down from 65 percent in the year 2003. And now just about half say success is likely in Iraq. In 2004, some 83 percent of those surveyed thought there would be a successful outcome. This is a survey of 945 active duty members of the United States military.

Just like the number of more than 22,000 troops wounded since the beginning of the war is a measurement of sacrifice. But no one here on the ground in the U.S. military really looks at it as a fair way to measure the success or failure of the war effort. They have a lot of other criteria that they use to measure, whether they think they're winning. They don't necessarily think that they're winning but they don't think that using that number of 3,000 deaths is a fair way to look at what's going on here in Iraq. Keep in mind that the troops, by in large, are very dedicated. They want to see this through. They think that this can be won and they think that, if they get, a lot of the troops on the ground when you talk to them, if they do get that increased number of troops with a very focused mission here, here in the Iraqi capital and in the west of Iraq in the Ramadi province, where the violence is really up in both places. Then they think that they could win this. What they don't want people back home to do is, they don't want them to hear that number of 3,000, and feel that it's anything more than just a really measurement of their sacrifice. They want to keep fighting here. They think this is winnable. They do say that, sure, there are some questions about whether we should have gotten in or out.

There has been a steady stream of visitors standing in Washington's January rain, waiting for the opportunity to enter the historic capitol rotunda to pay their respects to America's 38th president, something they will have the chance to do until 6:00 this evening. Shortly before 9:30 this morning, two of Mr. Ford's children, Michael and Susan, accompanied by her husband, stopped for a reflective moment at his flag-draped coffin. And then surprised members of the public by staying in the chamber and personally greeting, saying \\\"thank you,\\\" shaking hands with these complete strangers who had stopped by to pay their respects to their dad.

He, of course, will be at the National Cathedral tomorrow for the funeral service. I was wondering today what motivated people to come actually stand in the rain, take the time and make the effort to pay their respects. And as I was doing that, read in the paper this morning in \\\"The New York Times,\\\" a letter written by a man who was killed in Iraq to his son. A kind of guide for the life of a seven month old son that this man will never see grow up. And in that letter he said to his boy, quote, \\\"Always pay your respects for the way people lived and what they stood for. It is the honorable thing to do.\\\" The words of 1st Sergeant Charles Monroe King to his son Jordan. Perhaps part of the motivating factor for the many who are standing in line in the rain today to do exactly the same thing.\",\n",

      "            \"Yes, that is the plan, President Bush and the first lady will be arriving back at the White House in less than an hour and then will be immediately heading up to the capitol rotunda to pay their respects to former President Gerald Ford. Mr. Bush certainly was not age to be present for the state funeral on Saturday. He and Mrs. Bush still at their ranch outside Crawford, Texas for their weeklong holiday break. But the president will, as Gary Nurenberg just mentioned, be present at the funeral tomorrow morning at the National Cathedral, where he'll be delivering a eulogy. President Bush certainly did have a great deal of respect for former President Gerald Ford. In remarks after his death, remarks before the nation, calling him a great man, a true gentleman and saying, \\\"For a nation that needed healing, for an office that needed a calm and steady hand, Gerald Ford came long when we needed him most.\\\" And certainly everyone is very aware of the fact that President Bush drew a number of the top members in his team in his administration from the Ford administration. Vice President Dick Cheney was chief of staff to Gerald Ford. The defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, was likewise, defense secretary under President Ford. Though it's important to point out the men certainly did not see eye to eye on every issue as was revealed very recently this week in a series of interviews. President Ford did not agree with President Bush's decision to take the U.S. to war in Iraq. He did not agree with making suspected weapons of mass destruction the primary justification for the U.S. invasion of Iraq. But he kept those concerns to himself because as many people said that was the kind of president he was. Now the two men last visited together in April, when President Bush was in California for a series of fundraisers. He stopped by President Ford's home in Rancho Mirage. Had a very nice visit, a very cordial visit, the two men shaking hands, appearing very comfortable with one another. But I think it's interesting that there was really a sense at that time because of President Ford's age and his health that this would likely be their last visit and that certainly did turn out to be the case.

No Pentagon contacts have exhibited symptoms, and we have no additional positive tests to report at this time.\\\" As for the spread of COVID at the White House, more staffers, including a fourth press aide, are coming up positive.

Vital signs and physical exam remain stable, with an ambulatory oxygen saturation level of 95 to 97 percent. Overall, he continues to do extremely well. I will provide updates as we know more.\\\" Dr. Wen, that certainly seems very encouraging, at least on the surface, given the apparent severity of the symptoms he had just a few days ago. What questions do you have for the president's medical team?\",\n",
      "            \"Wolf, if another doctor gave me a presentation like that about a patient, I would immediately wonder, what's missing? Because here's what we don't know. We don't have the entire trend of the president's oxygen levels, which is what we would want to know. We don't just want to know one level. We want to know the trend over time. We also, very critically, still don't know about any chest X-ray, chest C.T. findings, which absolutely there are some, based on the president's symptoms and signs, the fact that he had these two drops in oxygen level when he was in the hospital, the fact that he's on dexamethasone and remdesivir for treatment. We know that almost certainly he has pneumonia. It's just a question of how severe that pneumonia is. And COVID pneumonia tends to be bilateral, affecting both lungs. So, we don't know that. Also, we have no information about other lab tests. Coronavirus could also affect the heart and cause inflammation of the heart. It could cause damage to the kidneys. It could cause inflammation. And we have no lab values to indicate that. And without those tests and information, we really have -- we're really left in the dark about what the president's prognosis really is.\",\n",
      "            \"And pneumonia for a 74-year-old, that could be very serious, right?\",\n",
      "            \"Absolutely. And we know that the president has multiple underlying conditions, which are all additive. Age itself is a risk factor. But, again, on top of that obesity and maybe some underlying heart disease, these are all additive. And the president is certainly not in any way out the woods. If, by the White House's own timeline, day one was Thursday, today is day six, which means that he's actually coming to the time, day seven through 10, in the next few days that could be the most serious for him when it comes to a possible deterioration.\",\n",
      "            \"The president, Dr. Wen, is apparently still taking steroids to treat his disease. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, she actually suggested in a phone call with House Democrats that the medication could be impacting his thinking, that it could have something to do with his decision, for example, to walk away from the economic stimulus negotiations. Are cognitive effects are real concern from this steroid medication?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, and I would even add on top of that, so, yes, steroids can induce psychosis, delirium, mania. There are real side effects from this medication. In addition, somebody having a fever could itself alter one's ability to think. Now, I know that the team has said that the president is not having a fever, is not on fever-reducing medications, although, notably, that was not in the report today. But I think just all of us have been ill before. And we know that, even when we're feeling ill, we're not ourselves. And if you have multiple conditions, pneumonia in itself could also alter mental status as well. So there are multiple reasons for why the president may not be thinking as he normally might be and might have the mental capacity that he normally does.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, he's taking various drugs, including experimental a monoclonal antibody cocktail. He's taking remdesivir. I guess to the fifth dose supposedly was going on today, in addition to the steroids. Abby Phillip, the president has stirred up a lot of controversy since leaving the hospital yesterday. First, he walked into the White House, took off his mask right away. Then he downplayed the severity of the virus once again, saying, don't be afraid of COVID, don't let it dominate your life. Now he's ending negotiations over a potential stimulus bill. What's your analysis of these rather chaotic 24 hours since the president's return to the White House?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, Wolf, from a practical perspective, what the president has been doing over the last couple of days does not make any sense. Especially being a symptomatic, contagious coronavirus patient walking into the White House and interacting with staff with no mask on makes less than no sense. But, from a political perspective, it's been so puzzling to watch these moves. The president's greatest weakness in this election going into his reelection is his handling of this virus and the perception that Americans have that he has a cavalier attitude toward the safety of the people around him and toward the handling of the virus, writ large. He demonstrated that vividly yesterday in how he chose to depart the hospital and return back to the White House, and then walking away from stimulus talks at a time when the Fed chairman is begging Congress to put some fiscal stimulus into this economy to prevent a catastrophe, and where he can benefit politically from giving people desperately needed aid just ahead of an election. Walking away from those talks and then saying that he is the reason the talks are collapsing makes little to no sense here. There is no sort of upshot to this. This is irrational behavior on the president's part. And it is going to hurt him at a time when he really can't afford to have these sorts of missteps, just 30 days before the election, literally a month from now.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, our political commentator Van Jones is with us as well. Van, so many people are suffering from the economic fallout from this pandemic. Millions and millions of Americans lost their jobs, nearly 11 million fewer jobs in the U.S. economy today, as opposed to last February, that according to the U.S. Department of Labor. But the president now says he won't try for another economic stimulus bill until after the election. Is he essentially holding this money hostage, telling the American public that they won't get relief unless they vote for him?\",\n",
      "            \"I mean, it sure sounds that way. I mean, this is probably -- we focus a lot on what's happening inside of the White House, because, obviously, it's a nerve center for the country. But you have to remember there are 300-plus million Americans, many of whom are suffering in ways that have not happened in this country in generations. We don't talk about the long, long lines for food relief, where people are sitting in their cars for two or three hours just to get a small box of food to take home. There's the amount of economic suffering. This particular recession has hit the poor, has hit people of color in devastating ways. If you listen to what the president said, he says, I'm not going to do anything until you reelect me. In other words, if, after the election, he hasn't won, he's not going to do anything in October, November, December, January. You're not going to get any help until spring. That is a shocking thing to say to a country that's flat on its back and suffering. And to do it 20-plus days in front of a national election is literally insane. I mean, all he had to do is just -- if he doesn't want to do anything -- he didn't have to do anything -- but to literally pull the plug and not to even tell Mnuchin, not to even tell Republicans, there is something desperately wrong in this White House. And it's now affecting the prospects of tens of millions of desperately needy Americans.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, there are a lot -- millions of Americans right now who can't pay their rent, can't pay their bills, can't even put enough food on the table for themselves and their families and their kids. And, David Gergen, by taking ownership over ending these critically important negotiations, isn't the president himself inviting voters to blame him if they don't see another round of stimulus money and don't see it soon?\",\n",
      "            \"Absolutely. And to pull the rug out from under the negotiations just when it seemed that the Treasury secretary, Mnuchin, as well as Nancy Pelosi, they were still apart, but there was a spirit of trying to get it solved. There was -- you sensed that this -- OK, they're ready now. They had been cross-purposes earlier, but they were ready. And here the president came and just pulled the rug out. It's just another day of madness at the White House. Wolf, I'm a little reluctant to use another comparison to Ronald Reagan, but there's one that's so apt. When he got shot, he kept out of the public eye for a while. He said he wanted to recover fully. People saw a couple of photos of him. But the first time he made a real appearance after he was shot was to come into a joint session of Congress, as you will remember, and ask the Congress to pass his major economic legislation. And there was such a wave of sympathy and support for Reagan, he got his economic package through by standing up straight, standing up tall, saying, I'm back, and he had to go to the country. When you compare that to Trump, who just wrecked his reputation once again, who had the opportunity to elicit sympathy and more warmth on his side. But since he's come back, he's been completely self- destructive. It does raise the question of whether these steroids in particular are affecting his judgment.\",\n",
      "            \"Yesterday, you suggested he was behaving, and you used this word, David, like a madman.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. Well, I do think that he's -- it often seems that we're in the grips of a madman. You know, the behavior is irrational. You sometimes ask yourself, whose side is he on? Who's he working for here? Because this is a man who we saw -- we saw in the '16 campaign really was very smart about doing things. He was very shrewd. He made a lot of calls that turned out to be right and a lot of us watching him turned out to be wrong. In this campaign, almost everything he's done has been wrong. It's just been a misstep. And he's not -- he can't find his voice. He can't find his footing. And now he's 16 points behind in the CNN poll? That's astonishing.\",\n",
      "            \"You know, Dr. Wen, it's -- there's going to be a vice presidential debate tomorrow night, the vice president, Mike Pence, and Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Apparently, the Debate Commission has decided to put some Plexiglas between them. They're going to be about 12 feet apart, but they were -- out of an abundance of caution, put some Plexiglas in between them. But we're not being told that the vice president and his staff, they don't want any Plexiglas near them. And they -- apparently, they don't necessarily have to have it right now. But what are your thoughts about making sure the vice president -- he's tested negative -- hopefully, he will remain negative. But at a sensitive moment like this, what are your thoughts about making sure that everyone is safe on that stage at the debate tomorrow night in Utah?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I'm not just worried about the people on the stage. Of course, I want for Senator Harris also to be healthy and for Vice President Pence to be healthy. But I worry about all the other individuals who may be put in harm's way by having this debate continue in person. Vice President Pence should not be traveling anywhere right now. He -- if he's to travel, then he's also not only endangering potentially himself, if he actually has coronavirus, but also all those other people that he'd be traveling with, the aides, the Secret Service agents, the others who may not be able to keep physical distancing from him during that time. He should be quarantined for 14 days from the time of the last known exposure to someone who he has had contact with who has coronavirus. And we have seen him in all these pictures with these individuals. He really should not be traveling anywhere, and he should set the example for the rest of the country. People with exposure should quarantine for 14 days, no exceptions.\",\n",
      "            \"And that's the recommendation, the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They say that. We all saw the pictures of the vice president sitting right in front of Senator Mike Lee of Utah at that Rose Garden Supreme Court event. They were literally within two or three feet of each other. And the vice president has spent some time with the president as well and others who have come down positive for coronavirus. Dr. Leana Wen, thank you very much. Abby, Van, David Gergen, guys, thanks to you as well. Just ahead, the uncertainty over President Trump's health and how it may be impacting U.S. national security. I will speak with the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Adam Schiff. There you see him. We have got lots to discuss, and we will when we come back.\"\n",

      "            \"U.S. military officials have called off a search-and-rescue operation for three Marines missing after their Osprey aircraft crashed into the sea off the coast of Australia. The Australian Navy has just found the aircraft underwater early this morning. 23 Marines were rescued after the plane crashed Saturday during a training exercise. The military says the search for the missing Marines is now a recovery mission. And U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says a unanimous United Nations vote slapping North Korea with the strongest sanctions yet shows the world is, in fact, united against the reclusive regime's nuclear ambitions. North Korea vowing to retaliate with a thousand- fold revenge- - a quote from Pyongyang -- saying it's missiles and nuclear weapons are not on the negotiating table.\",\n",
      "            \"So the next step is obviously to see that the Security Council resolution sanctions are enforced by everyone. And we hope, again, that this ultimately will result in North Korea coming to the conclusion to choose a different pathway. And when the conditions are right, we can sit and have a dialogue around the future of North Korea.\",\n",
      "            \"Let's go to the Pentagon where our reporter, Ryan Browne, is. Ryan, you have the U.S. U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, saying this is a big win, a rarity to have China, Russia and the United States on the same page with these sanctions. But what do the sanctions mean?\",\n",
      "            \"Brooke, the sanctions are targeting to get after the hard currency that the North Korean regime gets in. That's money they use to invest in their nuclear and missile programs. And Ambassador Nikki Haley said this will target about one- third of North Korean exports, so about a billion dollars potentially, coal, iron ore, and even capping the number of laborers North Korea sends to other countries, like China and Russia, which is another source of capitol. So again, trying to get at that money, looking at banks that do business with North Korean companies, joint venture international companies. Really trying to curb that money. But as you said, the North Korean foreign minister very clear these sanctions were not going to have any effect on the nuclear and missile programs. They would continue to protest and pursue these things. Again, as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said, a lot of this will be about enforcement with the countries that do a lot of business with North Korea, China amongst them. Whether or not they actually enforce these sanctions will be something to watch. But again, North Korean, Pyongyang remaining very defiant even in the face of this unanimous vote by the U.N. Security Council\",\n",
      "            \"Ryan, thank you. Let's continue the conversation. Aaron David Miller is with me now, CNN global affairs analyst and former State Department advisor. So, Aaron, you have Nikki Haley calling these North Korea sanctions a gut punch. We know President Trump hopped on the phone with President Moon, so South Korea last night. And the president tweeted, \\\"The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact.\\\" Ryan made a great point about a country like China enforcing these sanctions. Do you -- what brought China on board? Do you think with all the president's threats against trade? Did that actually work?\",\n",
      "            \"I think President Xi is playing a clever game. He wants to do just enough -- and it's no doubt this is clearly an improvement, a public denunciation of the regime by the Chinese foreign minister. Usually, they do these things in private. But I think President Xi wants to do just enough to prevent the president from interfering with his really agenda, which is to project Chinese power to the South China Sea. And the ASEAN conference clearly contained a pretty week code of conduct. And to pick off former American allies, the Philippines, and fill a vacuum left by the United States. And to avoid trade sanctions and a war. So, yes, I think President Xi is willing to do more. But these are necessary steps, these sanctions, but they're by no means sufficient. My grandmother used to say chicken soup, who knows if it helps, but it doesn't hurt. There's no question this doesn't hurt, but these sanctions are not going to get Kim Jong-Un to stand down. I suspect he's going to test again. And this time, it may be a sixth nuclear test. That'll be his response.\",\n",
      "            \"So you even if it's amounting to a third of North Korea exports, a billion dollars, hitting them financially, that won't stop them from doing another ICBM?\",\n",

But remember, the baseline for what North Koreans are capable of suffering and sacrificing has been in trade since the 1950s. The elites won't suffer. Kim Jong-Un and the regime and those necessary to support him in power aren't going to suffer. The North Korean economy grew by 8 percent or 9 percent last year. It depends on whether or not the Chinese are willing to do everything contained in that sanctions resolution. Frankly, I doubt whether they're prepared to do enough to really force that kind of pain and a possible collapse of the regime.\",\n",

But if you think about, it touched bottom back in May, it had what's known as a \\\"double bottom,\\\" where it hit this floor, just below about 89 cents, and then hit it again, and then seemed to pick up. And a lot of people, at that point, started calling the turn, saying, right, this is it, the euro is really going to comeback, it is going to recover in quite a big way. But it just hasn't. It's been trailing around this kind of 93, 94 cents level for a long time now, and as you say, it's up a bit again today. But it's still only around 94 cents, and that kind of strong, sustained recovery in the euro that some people hope to see just apparently hasn't happened yet.\",\n",

And that really does seem to be the answer, and it's something we're going to be looking at, I think, in tomorrow's paper -- we're just working up a feature on this at the moment -- is really what's going on in the European economy. And obviously, there has been a lot of optimism, everyone has said, Europe's looking up. But then just lately people have begun to say, well, hang on, perhaps this story isn't really as solidly based as we thought, particularly perhaps in Germany; people are saying that economic growth isn't really all that strong. We've had, for instance, just recently a very weak business survey out of Germany. And then people contrast that with what's going on, say, in some of the fringe countries of the European Union. Ireland absolutely going crazy, the economy roaring away, inflation up to a 15-year high level, having to put price controls on the price of a pint of Guinness because they're so worried about how prices are taking off there. So strong tensions still existing there in the European economy, creating problems for European Central Bank, which probably is going to put up interest rates a bit more in the course of this year, but perhaps isn't going to put up interest rates all that much further. And so that really creates a problem then for the euro. But still, the prospects of the European economy don't look fantastic compared to -- still prospects in the United States looking pretty good with this apparently positive path down towards a soft landing that now everyone's talking about in the United States. So, as you say, European investors still -- do still apparently find the United States very attractive, as with Deutsche Telekom buying VoiceStream, as with Vivendi and all these European companies still coming in, buying U.S. assets. It does still seem that the U.S. and the dollar is the place to be.\",\n",

There are expectations, for the most part, at least sort of 50-50 lately, that the Federal Reserve here in the U.S. is going to, for the most part, stand pat, at least at their next meeting. You did mention that the European Central Bank is expected to raise interest rates by -- not by all that much. Is there any sort of specific estimates on how many more increases we could see in Europe?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. Well, I think, I mean, they are up meeting this week, I think, certainly, we wouldn't see a rise this week. But maybe we think, perhaps another half of a percentage point, perhaps three- quarters of a percentage point. I mean, I think, it's very unlikely. For instance, the last time they raised rates they went up by a full 50 basis points, half of a percentage point. I think that's very unlikely we'll see that again. We might just see them edge rates up by a quarter of a percentage point, say, two or three times for the rest of the year, so not huge increases. Some increases still the come, but I think, certainly, they're very worried about this potential weakness, particularly in the German recovery, and so that is likely, we think, to stay their hand for more aggressive rate rises.\",\n",

Twenty-year-old Michael Donald was killed by Klansmen in Mobile, Alabama, in 1981. The incident inspired Ravi Howard's first novel, \\\"Like Trees, Walking.\\\"\",\n",
      "            \"Howard tells the story through the eyes of Roy Deacon, a high school student who is being groomed to take over his family's business. The youth not only helps bury his victim, he goes on to live with the terror the killing inspired. Here again is NPR's Michel Martin with novelist Howard.\",\n",
      "            \"I understand that as a native of Alabama, you remembered this terrible killing from your childhood, but do you remember how you heard about it?\",\n",
      "            \"I remember hearing it from family members who were just shocked that a crime like this had happened, especially in 1981, given everything else that was going on. So this kind of recounted - it was recounted to me through just family phone calls and my parents telling me about it.\",\n",
      "            \"Do you remember in your child's mind what you thought was going on, I mean, were you personally scared?\",\n",
      "            \"I was actually a little bit, because also at this time an interesting point is that the Atlanta child murders were going on. And that was something that many, I think, black families in the South were watching from afar and were really feeling the pain of a lot of families in Atlanta. But then for those in Alabama with the killing of Michael Donald, a lot of people thought that it might have been a copycat crime. So there was concern from a lot of people.\",\n",
      "            \"What prompted you to write this as a fictional piece? I mean the real story is very compelling.\",\n",
      "            \"I think - that is an interesting point, a lot of people have raised it. I think the story is wide and very rich with so many storylines within the non-fiction of what actually happened. But I think the way I told it is consistent with what I've enjoyed about stories or what has been compelling, which is more of a street-level view coming from one person's perspective.\",\n",
      "            \"And I think sometimes when I look at history, I think about what if, what if I was there, what if I had to experience some of the things that were experienced by others. And so, as I writer, I just put fictional characters within certain situations to kind of see how they might react.\",\n",
      "            \"One are the things that you write about in the novel that you capture, I think, with great detail is the way that the terror of this one incident seeks into everybody's daily life, and I wondered how you got the idea for that.\",\n",
      "            \"I think it was important to me because I love, you know, non-fiction books, but I think with the fiction I wanted to kind of capture within that moment when the characters did not have access to the aftermath or what's next. So I just wanted to show just in as realistic a sense as I could what actually happens as these characters are living their daily lives, having to deal with this aftermath.\",\n",

They're dealing with, you know, preparing for the prom, dealing with school plays, all of these things that are normal in their development as young people. But they're also dealing with the aftermath of this horrific crime. And in our lives we can't necessarily separate those. We still have to go about our daily business. But I wanted to kind of show how this people cope.\",\n",
      "            \"The other device that you used is that of the funeral home. And your protagonist is the seventh generation of this long line of family members who ran this funeral home, and you imagine the passed down knowledge of how to repair a body broken by lynching. Where did that idea come from?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I do have an uncle that works at a local funeral home in Mobile, Alabama, so that was one source of research. But also just looking at the role that, you know, funeral homes have played in the black community as not only businesses, but also as, you know, spiritual avenues, because they are there in churches when people are being buried. Because sometimes that's really the only avenue throughout history, the only avenue that a lot of black people have had after a death like this.\",\n",
      "            \"They might not get the kind of legal remedy they wanted, but they will look for some sort of honor for that dead person through a funeral, through a church ceremony, through the religious rights that kind of made everyone feel like there is a better world somewhere.\",\n",
      "            \"What do you imagine your African-American readers taking from this story? What do you imagine your white readers taking from this story? Do you think it will be that same thing or different things?\",\n",
      "            \"That's an interesting question. Because I think for some people -especially African-Americans like myself who grew up in Montgomery, Alabama -there are a lot of people in our families that have first-hand knowledge of certain things that happened in the '60s or '70s.\",\n",
      "            \"So I would want them as well as, you know, the white readers to take away, you know, these are moments of history that happened. And we can't necessarily be ashamed of things that happened in our past, because I don't think there's any shame in discussing history or reflecting a fully textured version of American history.\",\n",

So that will be interesting to kind of compare my life growing up there with some of the things I want to look at that happened in the 1950s there in Montgomery.

      "            \"WAKE-UP CALL. I'm Ali Velshi, joining you live this morning from New York. We're interrupting our CNN international coverage of the trial of Hosni Mubarak. It is a story of historical significance unfolding this very moment in Cairo. We are staying on top of it, however. The deposed president of Egypt on a stretcher in a cage in the courtroom, on trial in the courtroom -- on trial on charges of corruption and ordering the killings of protesters earlier this year. There you can see him. It's just an extraordinary turn-around in the fortunes of Hosni Mubarak, from long-time iron-fisted ruler to infirmed, elderly defendant. He faces the death penalty if he's found guilty. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom is in Cairo right now. He joins us. Mohammed, what can you tell us about these morning's developments?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, Ali, we can't stress enough just how historic this is. It's unprecedented that a ruler like Hosni Mubarak, the deposed leader of Egypt, would actually be in that courtroom wearing a prisoner's uniform in a cage on a stretcher as a defendant. It's shocking to people here in Egypt. Many people we've spoken with today just didn't believe they would actually get to this point. They believed the trial might be delayed, might be adjourned, that maybe Hosni Mubarak wouldn't be transferred from his hospital bed in Sharm el-Sheikh. That all happened. He's in court. We're outside the police academy, the venue for this court. There's about a thousand people here, pro and anti-Mubarak factions. Earlier, there was scuffle broke out. Rocks were being thrown, bullets rung out at one point. That's calmed down. There are anti-riot police out here. But this is something so symbolic and there's so much passion about this in the streets of Egypt, there's a lot of concern that there could be demonstrations. There could be violence later in the day. So, there is an intense and increased security presence trying to make sure any kind of demonstration or violence is quelled as quickly as possible -- Ali.\",\n",
      "            \"Mohammed, tell us about Mubarak's two sons? Are they also -- this case -- we're seeing a close shot of it with Hosni Mubarak. But there actually -- it's a big cage. There are a lot of people in it, including his two sons.\",\n",
      "            \"That's right. Again, this adds to how unprecedented and extraordinary this is, not just that Hosni Mubarak would be in that cage treated as other criminal defendants, other criminal defendants in Egypt. That's the protocol in the courtrooms here. But his two sons are there with him. Gamal Mubarak, his son was seen for many years as the heir apparent of Hosni Mubarak. So, the fact that he's there, his two sons are there, former cronies are there, very symbolic to the Egyptian people that possibly justice is being done. Still, a lot of skepticism as to how this will turn out, whether they'll see it be a speedy trial or not, but again, people here are just shocked and riveted to the television screen. There's a huge screen outside the venue. About 1,000 people out here, all of them watching the drama unfold inside the courtroom, really shock at what's going. And right now, actually, the scuffle that's broken out, those scenes of violence might be on the rise again outside this venue. We're trying to find out what's going on. But another fight has broken outside the police academy -- Ali.\",\n",
      "            \"OK. Give me a sense again of the police presence outside the courtroom? And is it police or is it military?\",\n",
      "            \"We're seeing police. We're seeing military and we're seeing anti-riot police as well. It looks like a minute ago, they were deployed to try to deal with the situation. It looks now like it might be calming down, a lot of onlookers. But it is very tense. It's a very sense mood outside this courtroom. There seem to be several hundred policemen. That includes military, that includes security -- possibly intelligence and anti-riot police. As of a few minutes ago, the crowd was riveted to the big screen watching the trial unfold. Now, onlookers are going to where a scuffle broke out. But it seems to have calmed down with the deployment of the anti-riot police. Just\",\n",
      "            \"We're here with where there's a lot of media set up outside the courtroom. We're close to where the crowd was gathered around the huge monitor to watch the trial unfold. Everybody shifted their attention a few minutes ago to a scuffle that seemed to have broken out. But it's calmed down. People now seem to be returning to watch what's unfolding inside. That's where the real drama is today, inside this courtroom. You see about 1,000 people out there, some of them carrying Egyptian flags. Some of them are wearing hats with the Egyptian flags on it. Others are carrying signs against Mubarak. And the worry has been that because there are pro and anti-Mubarak people out here, there could lead to some more scuffles. And one more thing I like to add, Ali, as far as Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the revolution here in Egypt, here in Cairo, that was cleared a couple of nights ago. It was quite shocking to see. I returned to Egypt yesterday. I've been here a couple weeks ago. A couple of weeks ago, there were hundreds of protesters out here in the tent city. They were demonstrating. It was cleared by the military a few nights ago. They don't want anything out there while this trial going on, during the month of Ramadan. They're afraid that that will lead to violence. Nobody is out there except for security and they're trying to make sure nobody gets out there today and demonstrates because they're worried that will lead to violence as well -- Ali.\",\n",
      "            \"All right. Mohammed, stay there where you are, when you got something for us, just let our producers know. We'll get right back on with any developments in this trial that we're following live here for our audience here in the United States and around the world. Now, in other news, the bloody conflict between the Syrian government and protesters might be coming to a head in the city of Hama. A human rights group says the government has sent tanks into the city and has cut off wireless and land line communications. Now, CNN managed to reach one resident who said the city is running out of food and supplies. The U.N. Security Council plans to meet again today to discuss the crisis. The secretary-general of the United Nations says Syria's president has lost all sense of humanity. Time now for your debt ceiling update -- and there is one. The president has signed the bill, turning it into a law. You're witnessing a close call. The deadline was just hours away from when the president signed it. The measure calls for up to $2.4 trillion in savings over the next decade. It raises the debt ceiling through the end of next year and establishes a bipartisan congressional super committee -- as they're calling it -- to recommend long-term fiscal reform, six local lawmakers from each chamber. A super committee as we call it. We'll know who is in it within a couple weeks. CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger talked to Anderson Cooper about it.\",\n",
      "            \"The question I have is that, is it a good political move for you if you're a member of Congress to actually be on this committee? Because, you know, you don't know what the results are going to be and it could be politically bad for you at home. There are some, Anderson, who have suggested to me, someone inside the administration, who said why not get those \\\"gang of six\\\" on the committee because they're the only ones who have come up actually with a bipartisan way to approach the deficit. So, we'll see if some of those folks get on it.\",\n",
      "            \"Take a look at the CNN-ORC international poll -- 77 percent of respondents said lawmakers acted like spoiled children during the debt ceiling debate. I know what you're thinking. That's an offense to spoiled children. Only 17 percent believe they acted like responsible adults. The U.S. escaped a slap from Moody's. The credit rating agency let the nation keep its AAA credit rating for now. But it's lowered its outlook on U.S. debt to negative. The Federal Aviation Administration got left behind in all this, by the way. The Senate went on recess without extending the agency's funding. That means, among other things, about 4,000 FAA workers on furlough probably won't be back to work for another five weeks until the government gets back. And the government will lose out on more than $1 billion in aviation taxes. What else could this mean? FAA administrator, Randy Babbitt.\",\n",
      "            \"We're going to suffer a lot of long term damage. We have billions of dollars in construction money that should be going out the door that's not -- this is money that's available. It's simply we can't spend it.\",\n",
      "            \"OK. Let's see how the world's money is doing. The Hang Seng and Nikkei both closed lower. The DAX and FTSE right trading lower as well. Let's go to Kristie Lu Stout. She is live in Hong Kong. Markets are down again this morning. I thought after we got the debt ceiling stuff done, we'd start to see some relief, Kristie.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. Well, here in Asia, investors are cashing out of the market despite that debt deal in D.C. The attention is fixed on weak global data and fears of a global economic slowdown. Most of the major markets here are down between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent. The Nikkei closed down more than 2 percent with exporters especially hit hard. Now, stocks in Europe, they are also in retreat. Investors there not only digesting news of the U.S. debt deal, but also worries of the debt situation in Italy and Spain. In fact, investors are selling down Italian and Spanish debt.

I think that there's lot of folks out there who are having a lot of second guessing, particularly after the events of this week about the frontrunners. And I think you saw it at the debate last night with one of the frontrunners. I think a lot of folks are starting to think about \\\"Well, you know, well this is real bullets. So this is actually we're going to recommend to the country who should be the commander-in- chief, who should be the president of this country.\\\" And I think Iowans will take that responsibility seriously that I did a great job four years ago as you mention when they have that decision, they put forward someone who is a fighter and we need a fighter, we need someone to shake things up. That's what Republicans are looking for. But how about someone who can shake things up and build things. You know, someone who can help bigot by Partisan support or things like welfare reform and health savings accounts and Iran sanctions and all the things that I've proven that I can do.

There's a lot of what he is saying and doing that actually is things that I said and did four years ago when I actually kicked off my campaign doing. Talking about, you know, restoring our manufacturing prowess in this country. I went around with a, you know, and with the campaign economic plan four years ago that talked about making America the number one manufacturing in the world. I kicked off my campaign in May of this year from a factory floor in Western Pennsylvania, his issue on immigration. One of the immigration group yesterday tweeted out. You know, when the campaign began, Rick Santorum was the only A when it came to, you know, Conservative policies and immigration. And the next closest person was a C. Now that you have two A's, three B's, I mean everybody has moved in our direction. So in some respects, you know, I can take it as flattery that people have begun to address some of the issues that I have been talking about. And, you know, and I think that's a good thing.

      "            \"Don, we were looking at the worst sell-off since March 24, 2003, when the Dow dropped 300 points. Right now, we're off the charts. I can't tell you when the Dow dropped this kind of level. I'm guessing that it occurred in the aftermath of September 11, with the markets reopened. I mean, we're still talking about a big difference between them, but, in the last couple of minutes, we went from a 200-point, 240- point loss, to 475. Actually, I heard the shouts on the trading floor. That is really what made me look at the board. There are a couple of reasons why the market is selling off so dramatically. You could have looked at what happened in China. Their version of the Dow Jones industrials, the Shanghai composite, dropped nearly 9 percent in one session. And the ripple effect just kept spreading west. All of the European stock market averages dropped at least 2 percent or more. But, right now, we're looking, if the Dow -- if the -- if the market stopped trading right now, we're looking at a 4 percent loss for the Dow Jones industrials. When the markets reopened after the September 11 attack, we were looking at a 7 percent decline, just to put in that perspective for you -- Don.\",\n",

      "            \"Well, I mean, the fact is, people have been saying for months, Don, that this kind of correction was overdue. And it's painful when it happens like this. But just to give you a perspective, the folks at Standard & Poor's, which monitor this, kind of said that the last time S&P; 500 index -- OK, that is the -- the broadest of the three major averages. There's the Dow, which is 30 stocks, Nasdaq, which is heavily weighted with tech stocks. And then you have the broader S&P; 500 stocks. They said, we have gone 942 days without a 2 percent decline or more in the S&P; 500. And that was the longest since 1950. So, a correction was long overdue. This one, the S&P; 500 right now is down 4 percent. So, it's -- it's -- it's a sell-off that is accelerating. It's the final hour of trading -- big volume here now. We're -- we're looking at about three billion shares traded. I'm trying to get an idea of whether we are going to close in on a record there. And just to give you the breadth of the market, for every stock that is on the rise here at the NYSE, there are seven more that are declining. It's even worse at the Nasdaq. There's 14 for every stock that is declining. So, it's a very pronounced sell-off. There's no question about it. But there are trading curves in effect right now. When -- when the market starts to gain a -- a lot of points, or to decline rapidly, there are trading curbs to slow it. What you really want is an orderly session. We still have that. The Dow Jones industrials would have to drop 1,200 points for trading to be halted. So, we're -- we're a long way off from that.\",\n",

And you can see, Susan -- we're watching the board as you're speaking there -- slowly going even more into the negative territory. Now, Susan, we're hearing that, during the session today, that all the drops came from technology stocks. Shares were dumped there, stocks in other companies that rely heavily on the Chinese demand. That is essentially what is triggering all of this, correct?\",\n",
      "            \"Right. Well, we had -- we had this big drop in China. And the Chinese market is one of the fastest growing in the world. So, their -- their -- the Shanghai composite had more than doubled in a year. And, so, that was ripe for a pullback. You had it come, a very pronounced one, in one day. And there's a lot of money that is going into China. We all know that. And, so, investors were spooked. And you saw it happen. You saw it, as I mentioned, continue to hit all of the major markets in the world.

What happens is, about 1:00, right after 1:00, these trading curbs set in, because a lot of -- a lot of automatic -- automated trading programs sell stocks when stocks go down a certain amount. So, these trading curbs were set up to say that machines, computers can't, all of a sudden, dump the market. People have ways around that, and who -- they really want to sell out of the market, this is the kind of thing you see. Now, it's very interesting, how we saw this sudden extreme drop to below 500 points lower. That is very serious, because I have been on the phone all day with people on Wall Street, most of whom were taking a lot of this as a buying opportunity. They are not getting out of their positions, because, when we have seen major drops like this, post-9/11 or in those -- those sorts of days, you saw the smart money getting back in. You don't typically see a bigger-than-100-point drop very suddenly right at a certain point in the day. Now, a lot of this is automated trading, Kyra. It means that machines are kicking in and saying that, we have hit a point on a stock, that we need to get out of it. There are a lot of people on Wall Street now very busy, in this last 54 minutes of trading, who I have been told are getting involved in trying to buy, which is why you saw this market go a lot lower, and you saw it pull back up while you were talking to Susan, to back into the 400s. It's now back into the 500s. This is not an isolated incident. I'm just looking at Toronto stocks, down over 400 points in Toronto. We saw European stocks got hit. We had this kickoff. And, remember, Kyra, they couldn't get it together. Before trading started today, we had bad news in Afghanistan. We had this news from China. We had news on durable goods orders. Then we got home prices. It just came at the market too fast. We have a lot of positive news today. Consumer confidence is up. We saw positive earnings from some companies. Oil is a little higher, but it's not dramatic. This is -- there's something wrong here. There's a -- there's a group of people, professional investors, who are losing faith in this market right now. As Susan said, a lot of people think this is oversold, and they're taking it out on the markets today.\",\n",

      "            \"How -- how do you sort of balance out? You're saying there is good news along with this bad news. So, just how bad is the bad news?\",\n",

Now, last I checked -- and this is changing very rapidly -- last I checked, for every one stock that was up, 30 or 35 were down. And I'm sure it's worse than that now. The bottom line is, if you are an investor, you're looking for those stocks that people are bailing out of right now. I have been on the phone with my Wall Street friends all afternoon. I'm telling you, if I thought there was a bigger problem, they would have told me: We're bailing out. We're selling out of this. We're selling out of that sector. That is not what I'm hearing from the professional traders right now. Now, I can only make so many phone calls, so I haven't got have a full, broad section. There is not a sense that there's a reason to get out of this market right now. Remember, rumors can trigger these kind of sell- offs. And, sometimes, they get to us after they get to the -- the trading floor. Susan will be checking that out. But...\",\n",

You know, it looked like the -- the Nasdaq and the S&P; 500 were worse off than the Dow industrials. But, right now, we're all -- we're looking at -- they are all about down 4 percent on the day. And I think that, you know, just to sort of echo what -- what Ali is saying, and -- you know, the market has been going basically in one direction since July. It's been going up. The pullbacks that we have seen have been very mild. They have been light volume. And they have been -- you know, there hasn't been a lot of conviction there. So, this is long overdue, Kyra. And, you know, one of the signs was, -- like, for instance, yesterday, we were talking about a big equity -- a private equity deal, the Texas utility, TXU, utility, being bought out. We haven't -- $45 billion, the value that was associated with this deal. That's the kind of thing that usually spurs investors to buy. And the market basically just sort of rolled over yesterday. You -- you were getting the sense that this -- this bull market was getting very tired. And this is a -- there was a confluence of events today that occurred that really triggered this market to sell off. Why it dropped 200 points, in addition to the 200 points that we saw already, I don't know yet. I haven't had a chance to talk to any -- any traders. but I have been talking to a bunch of them all day, and they were all saying this was long overdue -- Kyra.\",\n",

Salt Lake County sheriffs yesterday said yesterday that they expect to bring charges against Brian David Mitchell, not in the connection with the abduction of Elizabeth Smart, but for the attempted kidnapping of her cousin last summer. The sheriff says he has strong evidence in the case developed since the recovery of Elizabeth. Charges could be brought as early as next week. In addition, we've now had a chance to look at some of the religious writings of Mitchell. In those writings, multiple references to polygamy, including one sentence which refers to bringing seven sisters to heart and home. Wanda Barzee, who is also in jail in connection with the disappearance of Elizabeth, had a visit in friend in jail. That friend emerged saying that Wanda told her that was a reference to polygamy, and that Elizabeth was one of the wives. Back to you.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, the family had -- the family had been imploring the police, \\\"Please look at this guy,\\\" and they didn't for a long time. What happened?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, that's the big question. Mary Katherine, the younger sister, was the only eye witness to this crime. She came forward to her family some time last fall and said, \\\"It's Emmanuel,\\\" this man who worked briefly on the Smart's home. The Smarts took it police, and police did not do much with it. The police say there were a couple of reasons they didn't. One, they had trouble for a while figuring out exactly who Emmanuel was. It took a while to match him up with the name Brian David Mitchell. In addition, they say this was a man who didn't have the sort of criminal record that made them interested in him. They didn't go forward with a sketch because they say the family produced three sketches of this individual that were different in nature. They were afraid of putting out the wrong one and developing a lot of false leads. One really interesting thing to us about this is that sketch, which shows a man without a beard. Also, if you go back to the initial description that Mary Katherine gave right after the abduction, there is no reference to facial hair. And yet in absolutely every picture we have seen of this man both before the abduction and since, he has what is very obviously a beard that he's had for some time.\",\n",

      "            \"It's really quite amazing. She heard he uncle shouting for her. She was held just a couple of miles away from her home for a couple of months. And then they emerged. They came back down into the city. I've talked to a number of people who spotted them while they were here. They have said that part of Mitchell's belief was that the women shouldn't talk. And so the women were never heard to say anything. They walked silently behind him. They've also said that Elizabeth appeared to be very comfortable with her companions, that she had opportunities when she might have been able to speak, when she might have been able to escape, that she did not take those. Unclear exactly why all of that happened. Police have said there is some sort of psychological impact here. Her father said she's been brainwashed. But people did not recognize her, in part because she had a veil across most of her face, but also because she was so much older and taller than what they expected. Most of the pictures we saw were of a relatively young girl. She's now a young woman. People just never made the connection.\",\n",

In fact, you heard me refer earlier to this second possible attempted kidnapping that they believe Mitchell is associated with.

And, you know, one question clearly comes -- weather and taking off in those kinds of wind conditions; usually planes are held on the ground and don't take off. But, you know, it's so early, Daryn -- obviously, as information comes in, I'm sure the story will change many times. But if, as reported, it's truly a tragedy. The 747 is a great plane; Singapore is a great airline and we're just going to have to wait over the next several hours to get more data.\",\n",

But, once again, we'll just have to wait and see.\",\n",
      "            \"Right, as you said, information is early and coming in. Now, The Associated Press reporting that this is a Boeing 747. The image that comes to mind for me is, that's a very large airplane.\",\n",

We've had some problems, as you know, with the TWA 800, which is a 747 -- a center fuel tank problem. There's been other wiring problems with those planes. But early reports here seem to point pretty directly to the weather on takeoff. So, certainly, a contributing factor, if not, necessarily, the reason for the crash.\",\n",
      "            \"OK, Michael, stand by; we're going to bring Flip back in to, once again, tell us what weather conditions are like in Taipei now and what it might have been like at the time of the crash -- Flip.\",\n",
      "            \"I have quite a bit more information for you, actually. If you were noticing on the news graphic that you just saw, you could clearly see the mountains that run up the center of the island of Taipei -- right up the middle. And we are told, on the eastern side of those islands, because of this strong easterly wind wrapping around the center of this typhoon, that they've had as much as 300 millimeters of rainfall. For those of us here in America, that's about a foot of rain.\",\n",
      "            \"A foot of rain in what amount of time, Flip?\",\n",
      "            \"Over the past 24 hours.\",\n",
      "            \"OK, so a lot of rain.\",\n",
      "            \"Very, very heavily at the time. Let me show you this graphic because this is what we're used to looking at here in the United States. The specifics on the storm, giving you the latitude and longitude, and I'll try to do some translation for you here. You can see that it's 233 kilometer west- northwest of Port San Vicente. This was, as of the last update, which was 5:00 a.m. this morning our time, here in the U.S. The wind-speeds were at 167 kilometers, that's 104 mile-an-hour wind-speeds associated with it; and it was moving to the north- northeast at about 26k, and that's at about 17 miles an hour, which is very, very rapid movement to the north-northeast. So what I was telling you when I was with you last time was you can clearly see in the loop the turn to the north and even back to the northeast. Sort of coming into the island from the back door. So it was, and is, a very, very ferocious storm and I'm sure that, within the last hour or two, things have been very nasty. Look at the dark orange area here in this enhanced satellite photography, the most recent one we have out of the area. That's about as bad as we show on this satellite photography.\",\n",
      "            \"All right, Flip, thank you very much; want to bring Michael Goldfarb back in here. Michael, those seem like some very severe weather conditions. It would seem surprising that any kind of airliner would try to take off in those kind of conditions.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, you know, a 747 can handle, Daryn, winds at 20, 30,000 feet because there's a lot of maneuverability. But on critical takeoff, where there's less margin for error, that kind of wind does create the wind shear. And, you know, there are wind-shear alerts warning systems -- low-level wind shear alert warning systems at most major airports here in the United States and at the large international ones as well. But I'm just surprised anything was taking off in that kind of weather, if it is as reported.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, you bring up the term \\\"wind shear,\\\" and I'm also seeing it on the wire copy in the early reports that are coming to us here at CNN. For those of us that don't fly, who aren't pilots, what is wind shear and how does it affect planes?\",\n",
      "            \"It's a sudden -- it's almost an unanticipated, sudden downdraft of convective weather so the wind is -- and that's the danger, it's insidious. It's not something you're in and, you know, you say, well I'm in wind shear and it gets worse. It hits suddenly and it's almost, like, pushes the plane down towards the ground. So it can't get any lift at a time when it's, you know, if it's coming off the runway and trying to reach V-1 and trying to, in effect, get airborne. It needs all of its thrust to get airborne; and it can't really recover from such a dangerous downdraft. We've had, here in the United States we've had, at Dallas-Fort Worth a Delta plane that, either on landing or takeoff, I'm not sure, suffered wind shear. But since then pilots avoid weather and the airlines don't fly in weather like that.\",\n",
      "            \"Our reports saying that because there was some type of wind shear, that eyewitnesses say that the plane fell flat to the ground, bursting into flames. When I hear the severe weather, it also concerns me when I think about rescue efforts.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. Well, I mean, certainly now, if you want to look at where this goes, rescue is the first -- first thing, hopefully trying to find survivors. But the plane was out of control, Daryn. At a point of that velocity of wind, I mean, there's really -- it doesn't perform aerodynamically, it literally, you know, pancakes to the ground or whatever might have happened.\",\n",
      "            \"And again, we don't have information on survivors or fatalities, but depending on how high that plane was as it was trying to gain lift, it does not bode well for people who were on board that plane, I would think.\",\n",
      "            \"Right. I would think that's the case. Any kind of crash with that size of aircraft -- and once again, this is speculation here. There could have been a mechanical problem on takeoff or any other number of things. As we often find out on these crashes, that what we think in the beginning is never truly how it ends. But at this stage, the weather certainly seems to have contributed.\",\n",
      "            \"Michael, anything else you can add that we haven't covered here?\",\n",
      "            \"No, I think we just need to wait and see over the next several hours, Daryn.\",\n",
      "            \"All right. Well, we'll be checking back in with you. Once again, to recap what we do know here, it's a Singapore Airlines flight. It's Flight 006. It was taking off from Taipei, Taiwan earlier today. A 747 headed to Los Angeles, California. It crashed as it was trying to take off. Weather at the time of the crash was very bad, as Flip Spiceland telling -- explaining to us: typhoon-like conditions. Don't know yet on survivors, fatalities, or on exactly what factor weather played in this crash. We will, of course, continue to monitor the situation out of Taipei and bring you more as we have it.\"\n",

I think that's the appropriate way to approach it and you should know and no one here today should take away any because of the fact that I don't want to speak about it there should be no negative inferences with respect to anything or for that matter positive inferences about the fact that I think it's most appropriate that while these investigations continue I not speak to the conversations I've had with the various investigative bodies.\",\n",

And for me, these questions being answered truthfully in a forthcoming way are critically important because it goes to the very essence of how you approach one of the most critical issues that we have. And your unwillingness to speak to it is troubling to me. Let me ask you this. President Trump has repeatedly said that, quote, \\\"Getting along with Russia is a good thing,\\\" unquote. Yesterday he tweeted a quote, \\\"Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it's ever been. There is no reason for this.\\\" And he indicated he would like to help Russia with its economy. What behavior, if any, has the Kremlin shown that indicates it wants to get along with the United States, or our allies?\",\n",

And if I am confirmed as the secretary of state, I can assure this administration will continue, as it has for the past 15 months, to take real actions to push back, to reset the deterrence relationship with respect to Russia.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, let's talk about that. Because I -- I see that's in your written statement, and you suggest that there is a robust response to Russia. On February 27th, Admiral Mike Rogers, the head of the National Security Administration and U.S. Cyber Command, warned the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Trump administration has not done enough to stop the Russians. Quote, \\\"I believe that President Putin has clearly come to the conclusion that there's little price to pay here and that, therefore, he can continue his activity.\\\" On April 3rd, the outgoing national security adviser, General H.R. McMaster, said, and I quote, \\\"We have failed to impose sufficient costs on Russia and that the Kremlin's confidence is growing.\\\" And then, for your reference, here are a series of mandatory provisions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, part of which I helped write, which have not been implemented by the administration. Section 225, Mandatory sanctions related to special Russian crude oil products; Section 226, Mandatory sanctions with respect to Russia and other foreign financial institutions; Section 228, Mandatory sanctions with respect to certain transactions with foreign sanctions evaders and serious human rights abuses in the Russian Federation; Section 231, Mandatory sanctions with respect to persons engaging in transactions with the intelligence and defense sectors of the government of the Russian Federation -- so there are more. That's not a robust response to Russia.\",\n",

      "            \"Thank you very much. Mike, thank you for your service at Intel -- at the CIA. That -- that has been great. For those of you on the committee, Senator Rubio and I are the only two that have the cross-pollenization, I guess. We have the -- the great privilege of serving on the Intel Committee. And we hear from the heads of all of the 17 agencies that we have that engage in intelligence matters. And over the years, over the 10 years I've been on it, we've had numerous heads of agencies come in. And sometimes, frankly, we -- we feel we're getting stiff-armed. I can tell all of you on this committee that Mike Pompeo has been candid when he came in before the Intel Committee. He has been helpful, and he has always been straightforward with us. So thank you for your service, there. You've earned my respect in that regard and you'll certainly get my vote for confirmation on this job. I think that that service, as head of the CIA, is going to serve you very well. As you -- as you know, it's served me very well on -- on this committee, having the -- some of that in-depth knowledge that you don't necessarily get in the -- in the public media. Head of the -- being Secretary of State is -- is unique, I think, as far as the agency heads are concerned. You, first of all, have the public duties. And as been referenced here, it's a very high-profile job in that you go around the world, being the face -- face of America and doing the kinds of things that you do. And I -- and your predecessor was very good at that. I thought he -- he carried flag as well as anyone could carry it. The job that -- this job, however, as Secretary of State, has a couple other facets to it that you have to do the same time and it's hard to keep all the balls in the air. One of them, of course, is being part of the management team with the president, as far as managing, really, the United States. And -- and thirdly, and I think very importantly, is the actual management of the bureaucracy. And I -- and I don't use \\\"bureaucracy\\\" here in a pejorative way. What -- with the -- the thousands of men and women who are in foreign service, who are -- who are working with the State Department, make us proud every day. They are bipartisan. They do a great job. I think that there has been a fair amount of criticism. Everyone knows that -- that your predecessor did have -- was hampered a bit because he didn't have some of those jobs filled that are so important there. And we all know that in order to manage an agency like that, you got to have really good solid people around you to be able to make the bureaucracy work in the things that aren't the high-profile meetings and what have you around the world. Could you tell -- could you give us your thoughts? Give us -- all of us your thoughts on -- on how you're going to go about that. Because it -- it needs some work. There's no question about it. It's going to make your job better. It's going to make the State Department work better. So could you give us your thoughts on that?\",\n",
      "            \"Senator, first, thank you for your kind words. I -- I did, as the CIA director, I have consistently tried to work closely with you and provide you with everything that you've asked for in a timely fashion. I think we've succeeded often, if not always, and we've worked diligently at it. I -- I promise to do that with this committee as well. With respect to building a team out of the State Department, this is something I've done multiple times in my life. I did it as a tank platoon leader, I did it as a cavalry troop. I did it for two small businesses in Kansas. And then I worked hard at it at the CIA. I'll leave to others to judge the success. But I did it because I knew it was imperative. At State Department, there are too many holes, too many vacancies, too many unfilled positions. When that happens, everyone's stretched thin in the subject matter expertise that is needed to deliver America's diplomacy around the world, to conduct its mission, its humanitarian missions, its development missions. Each of the missions to -- which are entrusted to the State Department require talented people on station doing their part, working alongside it. The way I'll think about it is the same way I did at the CIA. I'll start with those things that I think are the biggest gaps, and present the biggest risk to America's capacity to execute its diplomacy. We don't yet have an ambassador to South Korea. We need one. There are a handful of other places that have a requirement for immediate attention. With respect each of those positions, I -- I am a talent hawk. I will find what I believe to be the best fit to execute America's diplomatic mission around the world.\",\n",
      "            \"And I will encourage, demand, cajole them to come join the team and be part of our organization in a way that can successfully deliver.

You've made reference to the fact that there are ambassadorships that are empty, I think there's 37 of them, and the good -- the good news is, that, you have a really deep bench at the state department and a good example is in South Korea. I had the good fortune of being there, as you know, recently, doing some things and the (inaudible) that it's -- that -- that's in charge there has done a fabulous job, as you know. And we do have that deep bench at the state department, but again, we do need the ambassadorships filled and we do need those, particularly, I think the top positions in the department field. And people with the authority to act and people with the authority to act and people with the authority to do the things that need to be done. So, thank you for that. I have every confidence you'll be able to do that. Your candor with the intelligence committee, I -- I -- I can tell you that if you can come in front of that committee and disgorge in a candid fashion, I have every confidence you're going to be able to do that here, so, thank you again for your service.

So I want to ask you a couple questions and I would ask that you give your views, not the president's, I want to know your views. Secondly, I would hope that you would briefly answer the questions because I have a lot of questions I want answered, so, please -- please respect the time restrictions that we're operating under. And let me start first, if I might, with the Iran nuclear agreement that's been referred to. There's no question that Iran's the bad actor here and they continue to be a bad actor. In this congress, with your help that we passed very strong legislation to provide additional sanctions against Iran for its non-nuclear violations, including its ballistic missiles and we want strict enforcement of the nuclear agreement. But it is clear, from what the president has announced that he wants to see changes in the nuclear agreement. It's also been very clear that Europe has said, pretty directly, we cannot unilaterally, the west, modify the agreement, and that Iran's in compliance with the agreement. General Dunford has said, unless there is a material breach, we have an impact in others willingness to sign the agreement if -- sign other agreements if we pull out of this agreement, with reference to North Korea, the challenges of entering into diplomacy. So, my direct question, if the president determines that you cannot modify this agreement and Iran is in compliance, what is your view as to whether America should withdraw unilaterally from the Iran nuclear agreement?\",\n",

The president has indicated his intentions to withdraw from the international agreement. It takes a period of time before it becomes effective. But he has already initiated the process.

Just recently the work that we did against Russia in response to the attack that took place in Britain, we worked with our European allies. We did so very closely. This would be after the president's announcement that he intended to withdraw from Paris. So it can still work. I'll give you another example. The coalition that this administration has built to put pressure on Kim Jong-un is unique and historic and important. So there will be places that our allies come alongside us and others that they don't.

One of the reasons why I've been -- apart from how well I know the nominee and the work he has done in intelligence is I think one of the critical components to be a successful secretary of state is that when secretary of state comes to town, leaders and diplomats need to know that this someone who is in the inner circle of the president, that has the president's trust and speaks for the administration. And I can just tell you from experience from the work that we've done with Director Pompeo that when -- if confirmed, when he comes to town, leaders around the world will know that someone who has not just access to the president but is part of the president's trusted inner circle and speaks for the president and for his policies is just critical for the success of a secretary of state. And I would imagine if you have spoken as you have all the living secretary of states, they would have told you that that component of that relationship is so important. And I would just say anything that would undermine that, obviously, is something that would undermine the ability to do the job in that way. I have a series of quick questions. And they are important because it gives people some context about your views on foreign policy and America's role in the world, which, by the way, predate your time at the Central Intelligence Agency. It includes your time in the House of Representatives and perhaps even before that. You still agree, do you not, on the matter of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, that the United States has an obligation to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty.\",\n",

      "            \"And there is this ridiculous argument out there when people talk about Russian interference and their efforts and so forth that that's no different than what America does when it promotes democracy. There are huge differences are there not? For example when they interfere in an election, they're trying to influence the outcome. When we promote democracy we're trying to improve the process not necessarily who they elect. Sometimes democracies elect leaders that are not as friendly towards the United States. When they interfered in elections they use -- they use government and their intelligence agencies and the like. When we promote democracy it's largely through the work of nongovernmental organizations who may receive assistance from our government. When they undermine democracy, they do it in secret. They hide it and they deny it. We do it openly. We brag about it. We're talking about it here today and when we promote democracy we do it at the invitation of someone in those countries, whether it's a political party, an organization. Oftentimes the government itself when they undermine democracy, they do so against the will of the people of that nation and other governments in place. There is no equivalence between the promotion of democracy and Russian and other attempts to interfere in democracy.\",\n",
      "            \"Senator, there is -- there is neither an operational equivalence as you've described it that is, the methodologies used are very different. Nor is there a moral equivalence between the two efforts. They are fundamentally different in every way and America's democracy promotion around the world is conducted in the way that America should be incredibly proud of.\",\n",
      "            \"And one of the first things autocratic rulers do almost by definition, is they violate the human rights of their people. And of course have no problem violating the human rights of others and we've recently seen to war crimes and atrocities repeatedly committed by an autocratic government in Syria with the support of autocratic governments in Iran and Russia. Therefore, I believe you would agree that defending human rights isn't just a good thing to do it and again -- or just the right moral thing to do, which it most certainly is defending human rights is also in the national interest of the United States of America.\",\n",

      "            \"Now, after the end of the Cold War, we had this belief that history had ended and everyone was going to be a democracy and everybody was going to embrace capitalism as we understand it was free economics and the like. That hasn't really worked out in the case of a lot of places, particularly China. They have most certainly not embrace democracy. They've actually gotten more autocratic and they have embraced the definition of the world economic order that basically means we will take all the benefits of global trade and global economics. But we do not intend to live by any of its obligations. And so I personally believe that it was a terrible mistake that leaders in both parties have made. And now as part of their strategy you see China doing things like trying to create strategic depth in Eurasia. Your efforts to establish all these different programs, the belt and road initiative, Silk Road Maritime, Silk Road, they're just efforts - they're not just efforts to create new overland trade corridors, they're efforts to basically make these nations economically, politically and eventually militarily dependent on and vulnerable to China. And their maritime borders in the South and East China Sea you see that they feel vulnerable and insecure. They see American allies in Japan, South Korea, Australia, Taiwan, and so what they're working on now is fracturing our economic and defense alliances in the Indo- Pacific region. That's why they're investing billions of dollars in building up their Navy and their Air Force to be able to establish air and sea denial to the U.S. military and ultimately make the argument that don't count on America's defense and/or economic partnership because it's just paper, they can't live up to it anymore. What is -- what are your recommendations for the president as far as how important that challenge is otherwise we're going to wake up one day and find that we've been driven from the Asia-Pacific region?\",\n",

We've got lots of opportunities as well. China certainly presents a strategic challenge to the United States of America. You laid out the various tools and mechanisms that they are using, mostly economic. The United States need to be prepared to respond across each of those fronts so that we can find the right ground, the right place where we can cooperate with the Chinese, where it make sense for America and in those places where it does not, we can confront them and make sure that it is America's vision, a democratic vision that continues to provide strength and resources for the world.\",\n",

Jane Velez-Mitchell coming to you live from Los Angeles where Conrad Murray`s lawyers struck back today, and they struck back hard. But the biggest revelation of the day, Dr. Murray`s fingerprint was found on the Propofol bottle that prosecutors believe killed Michael Jackson. However, in a twist, four mystery fingerprints with were also found on items right around Michael Jackson`s deathbed, including the saline bag that prosecutors say was holding the killer Propofol. Police tested everyone in and around the mansion, but they cannot identify who left those mystery fingerprints. So, whose prints were they? And can the defense use this to their advantage for reasonable doubt? Meantime, look at this. It`s the defendant, Dr. Conrad Murray, his girlfriend/witness, Nicole Alvarez -- you remember the one, \\\"My body is my instrument\\\" -- and their son out on the town just a couple of nights ago, looking like they`re having a pretty good time. Actually, this is the very night that Nicole Alvarez testified. Now, the defendant doesn`t look particularly worried, does he?

You know, there`s obvious commercial value in the window into Michael Jackson and how he was when he was not on stage. But it`s actually, I think, going to be very damning at the end of the day for him and very helpful to the prosecution to show, he should have treated Michael Jackson better.

The Ativan, the Lorazepam, the Versed, the Midazolam. The other medications all combine together to decrease your respiratory drive and to really sedate you. This was a medication that was prescribed, apparently, by him, because it was in the document here, that reverses that.

She never photographed the key piece of evidence, the Propofol bottle, while it was still inside the I.V. bag that was holding it. And lastly, she did not collect a juice bottle, and the defense keeps -- the criminal defense attorney is now scheduled to argue that Michael Jackson used that untested juice bottle and filled it with Propofol and may have chug-a-lugged it.

It was gathered four days after the fact. The investigator`s fingerprints are on the syringe. The investigator never tests the juice bottle that`s next to Michael Jackson`s bed. This is critical.

Simpson case, with the garbage-in, garbage-out defense style. And now every big case does it. If they have a really -- they`re dealing with a mountain of evidence, what they do is say, \\\"Oh, it was collected in a very sloppy fashion.\\\" Your response?\",\n",

Are they critical? That`s the issue. For example, having strayed fingerprints from the investigators on something happens all the time. Should it happen? No, but it`s a mistake. That`s why you keep a log of the people who handle the evidence, who are at the crime scene, so you can rule them out if you have a fingerprint that doesn`t belong to either a victim or a defendant. And they do, and they did. They identified it. No big deal. That they didn`t collect the juice bottle, that is unfortunate. Will it actually allow them to argue that that`s how Michael Jackson got hold of the Propofol and drank it himself? That I`m not so sure of. Because I do know that drinking Propofol is something extremely difficult to do and painful. So that -- and, I have to say, the finding of Propofol in the stomach of Michael Jackson turns out to be not the result of ingesting orally, but because there was bleed-back inside of him. In other words, it bled into it stomach. It didn`t mean that it was drunk by him. So I don`t know that the failure to collect the juice bottle is as critical a mistake as they`re going to want to make it seem.\",\n",

That`s why he was attracted to children; that`s why I know that we connected early on, because there was that connectivity of wanting to recapture something of his childhood.

And that`s one of the things that I think was painful for Michael was that he had no empathy from anyone, because there was no one who had reached that level of success as a child and then reached that as an adult. So there is a definite isolation that takes place. And if you do have stage parents -- which I didn`t, thank God -- there can come this total isolation. Even at the -- like where I was, I was nationally known, but it was for a short period of time. And for the rest of my childhood, though I stayed in the industry, I didn`t have international prominence.

He might have had monitoring equipment. He might have had resuscitation equipment that would have saved Michael`s life.

When people use elephants as entertainment, most don`t think, oh, they see these beautiful animals going here, there or everywhere. They don`t realize how these animals were captured; how they were taken from the wild. Elephants tortured and abused to perform for humans. Elephants tortured and abused to perform for humans. But one 14-year-old girl figured it out. She made the connection. And now she is making a movie, \\\"How I Became an Elephant\\\" and it`s changing hearts and saving lives, one person and one elephant at a time.

She meets probably the person of elephant information across the globe. The name is Lek Chailert and she has an elephant sanctuary there in Thailand. A lot of people don`t realize that there`s really only been one way to train elephants from hundreds of thousands of years. It goes back. It is an Asian technique.

      "            \"Part two of our week-long special report, \\\"Scientology: A History of Violence\\\" just ahead tonight. But first up, breaking news on a teen girl allegedly bullied to death. Just moments ago we learned of new disciplinary action against more high school students in connection with the death of this teen. Her name was Phoebe Prince, 15 years old, she came from Ireland. She was new to America. New to a school where she hoped she'd find new friends. Well, instead, Phoebe was bullied for six months, literally up until the day she died. That day was January 14th. She went home and hanged herself. Tonight the school district in South Hadley, Massachusetts, announced that they've expelled a number of students from the high school. Now, this is in addition to the nine teens who have just been criminally charged in connection with her suicide. But I've got to tell you, kids are dying across the country and all too often school officials kind of throw up their hands and say, \\\"Oh, we had no idea.\\\" Well, tonight we're \\\"Keeping Them Honest.\\\" I want to bring you over to the wall just to show you some -- give you some sense of just how serious and widespread this problem is. I mean, Phoebe is just one of many who have allegedly been bullied to death. This is Carl Joseph Walker Hoover; he was 11 years old. He lived not far from Phoebe Prince. He was taunted by classmates. They called him gay. His mother begged school officials to do something to stop it. He hanged himself as well. Just 11 years old. This is Jaheem Herrera (ph), we told his story a while back. He also was 11 years old. His mother says bullies called him gay, called him ugly. And they called him the virgin because he was from the Virgin Islands. He also hanged himself. I mean imagine an 11-year- old hanging himself. Just a few, a few months -- a few days ago just outside New York, 17-year-old Alexis Pilkington took her own life. Her parents said she was already in a lot of pain but she was taunted online at a social site before, and even after her death they were taunting her online. Police are investigating. Now, we're going to talk tonight to Dr. Phil, who's done a lot of programs about this, about the problem of bullying and why he says we all need to wake up about it. I want to give you some numbers, though. One in five children, according to Love Our Children USA say that they have bullied somebody. One in four says they have been bullied. 42 percent of kids say they have been bullied online. And as many as 160,000 kids across the country say they've been so scared of their tormenters, of their bullies, they've actually stayed home from school. But, I've got to tell you, not enough is being done about it. Kids are dying. 41 states now have some kind of anti-bullying legislation on the books. Nine, including Massachusetts don't, though a bill is making its way through the legislature. Lawmakers say that Phoebe Prince's suicide is a big reason why that's happening in Massachusetts. But \\\"Keeping Them Honest\\\" tonight, Massachusetts has been trying unsuccessfully to pass anti-bullying legislation for a number of years. So why didn't they? And what about Phoebe's school? I mean teachers and staff knew about the bullying, according to the district attorney; so did other students. Did they do enough to stop it? Well, Dr. Phil shortly but first, Gary Tuchman is \\\"Keeping Them Honest.\\\"\",\n",
      "            \"Phoebe Prince spent her last day alive tormented by her classmates. It began at the school library where according to prosecutors the 15-year-old was harassed in front of a faculty member. The bullies then taunted and threatened Phoebe with physical violence in the hallways and it continued as she walked home. It ended when Phoebe's younger sister found her lifeless body hanging in the stairway, leading to her family's apartment. She was still wearing the same clothes she wore to school. Officials say what happened to Phoebe in January was not an isolated incident.\",\n",
      "            \"They were the culmination of a nearly three-month campaign of verbally abusive, assaultive behavior and threats of physical harm towards Phoebe on school grounds by several South Hadley high school students.\",\n",
      "            \"On Monday, prosecutors announced charges against nine teenagers, seven girls and two boys, in connection with Phoebe's death. Two of the nine also face statutory rape charges. Phoebe Prince, who moved to western Massachusetts from Ireland in the fall, briefly dated one of the accused. Sean Mulveyhill. Students say he was popular, an athlete. Phoebe was a freshman from out of town. And apparently the other girls didn't like that she and Mulveyhill were dating. And when the relationship ended, prosecutors allege a round of intense bullying started. According to students, books were knocked out of Phoebe's hands, her photos were defaced and threatening messages were sent to her cell phone and over the Internet. But it turns out, this wasn't the only incident. Phoebe Prince had allegedly been bullied for months, sometimes in front of faculty members.\",\n",
      "            \"Prior to Phoebe's death, her mother spoke with at least two school staff members about the harassment that Phoebe had reported to her. Some bystanders, including at least four students and two faculty members, intervened while the harassment was occurring or reported it to administrators.\",\n",
      "            \"So a faculty witnessed it and school administrators knew about it, as prosecutors say, then why wasn't it stopped? That's what Barbara Coloroso wants to know, an expert of school bullies. She spoke to school administrators and faculty last year about the warning signs of bullying. Now she's wondering, was anyone listening?\",\n",
      "            \"Teachers needed to know that if they reported it to administration it would be followed through with consequences where not only is the kid accountable but the parents of those bullies are notified so that they're working on the issue at home as well.\",\n",

She comes to this new country, she starts a new school. And after six months of repeated harassment, which a lot of people seemed to know about, she ends up dead, hanging from a stairwell in her home. I mean, it's just sickening when you think about it.\",\n",

It's doubly tragic when one takes their life. But when it is inside a system that is guaranteed, supposed to be protecting our children, nurturing our children, advancing our children -- that is just unacceptable. This is outrageous. My concern here is it's outrageous at many different levels. I have a belief, and that is that if you stand by passively, whether you're an adult or another student, a peer, whatever, if you stand by passively and watch somebody being bullied, you are as guilty as the person that's doing the bullying.\",\n",
      "            \"So you support the criminal charges that have been filed against the people accused of bullying?\",\n",
      "            \"I do support the criminal charges. Look, I don't want to destroy these kids' lives because they are kids. And their brains aren't even through growing yet. They don't have the ability to predict the consequences of their actions. I doubt in their hearts of hearts that any one of them would have wanted this outcome if they took a moment to think about it. But, Anderson, we've got to have accountability. This is at epidemic proportions. It's happening on the Internet. It's happening on the schoolyards. It's happening more with girls. And here's a question, Anderson, where are the parents of these bullies? How are these kids out there bullying someone to the point of taking their own life and their parents either don't know it or don't care or condone it? It's their job to know what their kids are doing.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, where are the parents? Where are the school officials? Where are the other kids in school?\",\n",

A Peshmerga commander says it will probably take at least two weeks before they are in position to try to enter the city.

That includes things like rehabilitating Mosul, rehabilitating places like Fallujah and Anbar that have been destroyed. You have to integrate the people that have left back into their local communities, back into their homes, back into their local economy.

You've got the Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the north. So what's missing is the political structures and the political agreements and frameworks that could enable any military gains to count in the short and medium term. What Iraq really needs is a serious effort to mend and reconcile some of the divisions and the problems because you've got a host of actors involved in this operation that have had conflicting agendas. They've had disputes over the past 10 years. These are the problems that have enabled groups like ISIS to thrive over the past 10 years, of course, because the organization has come in different forms in the past. And even after the initial operation, they could splinter into different groups and still make use or exploit those kinds of political disputes and disagreements.\",\n",

She was a reporter for \\\"People\\\" magazine at the time and in that same magazine she now writes this, \\\"Women are talking about this and they need to. We cannot be silent anymore. I didn't tell my story for politics. I did it for women.\\\" Trump says Stoynoff along with at least eight other women, they're all lying, but he's yet to provide much evidence to refute their claims.

It's not because they're trying to go out and get or do something to that other person.

First, late word out of Pentagon tonight, possibly related to the murder that Jordanian fighter pilot by ISIS. A U.S. official telling CNN's Barbara Star that the military has moved search and rescue personnel into Northern Iraq. Now this after news that the United Arab Emirates to dropout out collation air strikes against ISIS, out of concern they say for any of their pilot who might go down. Breaking News as well involving a shadowing woman, the widow of Paris supermarket killer Amedy Coulibaly. She fled the city, turned up on surveillance video at the airport in Istanbul. That where there, she was tough have gone to Syria. Well tonight there's a new video from ISIS featuring a woman who French authorities say may resemble the Paris terror widow. More on that from justice corresponded Pamela Brown who joins us now. So this new ISIS video and we're just going to show a screen grab from -- where not going to show the video. What are your sources telling you, could this actually be her?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, the source says telling us that French investigators are right now looking into that very possibility that the woman seen here wearing a camouflage (inaudible) seen in this latest ISIS video release by French. ISIS fighters could be Hayat Boumeddiene said to be France's most wanted woman for her knowledge of the Paris attacks as you mentioned. But it's the lead, this is understanding note that Boumeddiene fled to Syria and link up with ISIS. And the believe among intelligence official is that ISIS would likely want to flaunt Boumeddiene in propaganda video and make it very clear that it's her, as you see that it's not case in this picture and we did our own very amateur analysis. And if you look closely at the picture side by side as we just saw there, right here the female fighter does not appear to look like Boumeddiene and some of the other (inaudible) that we look at, Anderson. So base on those features, it doesn't appear. But this is up to the French investigators to figure out. And of course they're much better equipped than we're to do that, Anderson.\",\n",
      "            \"I mean there certainly no shortage of women from what we've heard going to fight or going to link up with\",\n",
      "            \"Yeah, that's right. It's not uncommon at all that there are these ISIS female fighters like the one in that picture. In fact I spoke about this issue with the head of the FBI's counter-terrorist in the division Michael Steinbach and he says that the recruitment of women by ISIS has been much more than we have ever seen by a foreign terrorist organization. There has been a deliberate focus by ISIS leadership to recruit women, to be everything from a female fighter, to bride for ISIS militant. And he said that even though the number of American women wanting to join ISIS is a minority compared to the men, it's much higher than we have ever seen here in the U.S. And in many cases we've seen ISIS is pushing out of false narrative of what it's like in Syria in order to lure women to come over. When in reality we know a lot of them are raped, sold or even die on the battle field.\",\n",
      "            \"Pamela Brown interesting development tonight. Thank you very much. Now Jordan and the latest there from Jomana Karadsheh. She joins us tonight from Amman. In terms of what you're hearing about the Jordanian government possible plans to respond to the killing of their pilot, to increase air strikes, what are you hearing?\",\n",
      "            \"Well Anderson, there were this indication that the Jordanians would wants to ramped up the military response when it comes to their retaliation against ISIS as they were saying. And official's sources are saying now that Jordan wants to increase the airstrikes that is carrying out as part of its coalition mission. Now the number of this airstrike is going to depend on a number of factors including weather and the location of these targets. We have heard from the Jordanian government. Jordanian officials have said and promise an earthshaking response, we also heard King Abdullah. Today we iterate that message saying that their response is going to be harsh. And this is something many here in Jordan are telling us they want to see. This country, not everyone was really united, people had mix feelings about Jordan's participation in that coalition against ISIS. But today, Anderson, talking to people on the street more and more Jordanian seems to be rallying around the King, rallying around the government. And they want to see that harsh military response against ISIS that the government is promising.\",\n",
      "            \"Are you also hearing a lot of support for the execution which took place two Jihadist, including that female -- would this female suicide bomber who try to take part in the 2005 attack in Amman?\",\n",
      "            \"We've heard this from a lot of people today their saying that this should be just the beginning of this revenge by the Jordanian government by the King here for the brutal killing of the pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh, whom many Jordanian really felt like his killing with something personal for them. He was seen as a national hero. We also heard Jordanian telling us they want to see more execution of ISIS link prisoners. Of course as, you know, Jordan does has a number of Jihadist, a big number of Jihadist that are in Jordanian jail. Some of them are ISIS link, some of them al-Qaeda link. Now it's not clear how many of them are on death row for terrorism charges. But really the feeling here is they want to see more this. And we heard from the father of the Jordanian pilot, Anderson, saying that these criminals are not -- he call them criminal saying that they do not compare to his son and that his revenge should be greater than the execution of prisoners.\",\n",
      "            \"Jomana, I appreciate your reporting. Thank you. Tonight digging deeper now into what can be glimpse from the murder video about the state of ISIS, whether this is another sign of an organization on the rise or if in fact it signals maybe the organization just declining. Joining us is Ali Soufan, former FBI counterterrorism, special agent and interrogator. You know this video I've been watch -- I stop watching this execution videos long time ago. But I watch this one because I mean this one is different in a lot of ways. Is it geared solely toward trying to get new recruits? Because everyone is talking about how this may have backfired, its ignited many people through out the muslin world against ISIS. But do they really care?\",\n",
      "            \"No, they don't. It is geared. This level of brutality is geared internally to the people that they still have in the organization. ISIS has been suffering all a lot of loses. They lost Kobani.\",\n",

In Iraq today we start seeing more tribes working with the government in fighting ISIS. They lost Diyala totally, so they don't have any control over it. They're having problems now in Anbar and so forth. So, they're suffering from a lot of province. So what ISIS want, they want to take the brutality to a totally different level with a hope of short-term overreaction, with a hope of shock in off, because if they survive the shock and off that they can all these crazy Jihadi's around the world \\\"We are in a fight against the crusade, we are in the fight against infidels and it is your religious duty to come and fight for the sake of the Islamic state and to the Islamic (inaudible).\",\n",
      "            \"And to the more war leaders talking about ISIS the more war leaders make it a -- that it's an even playing field between ISIS, almost state actor. That plays into ISIS's hand, you're saying.\",\n",
      "            \"It plays into ISIS's hand if we do that. But what we have been doing here, we're developing the strategy with the airstrikes, with finding people on the ground to have coalitions against ISIS, Sunni tribes in Iraq, Kurds in Syria, deferent affiliates of the Free Syrian Army and different opposition groups in Syria. When you're trying to -- when you're having that and these individuals and these groups start gaining the ground in Syria and in Iraq while the airstrikes is killing ISIS, killing their soldiers, killing their best leader without giving them the theater, without giving them the show, they're giving them -- the only thing that's happening is they're being killed in a battle where they can not show anything for it, to incite people and to recruit people. But in the same time what they're focusing on, is focusing on giving the fighters that they have a sense of revenge. What they are focusing on is catering to the most radical elements of the group. What's focusing on is trying to have a short-term overreaction by the international community, so they can actually show case it, that the Islamic state and the Khilafah is under attack. The airstrikes, the sustained airstrikes, the long-term strategy in killing them with a thousand cut, in bleeding them to death is bothering the heck out of them.\",\n",

      "            \"And that's exactly what ISIS is trying to do now. They suffered a lot of loses in many different areas and they suffered a lot of lost especially with their topnotch fighters in Kobani. Kobani was standing ground and they lost.\",\n",

Not necessarily better cooperation within the agencies in the United States. But between the United States and our allies, for example that you have a lot of legal reasons that justify not sharing information about suspected foreign fighters and about suspected terrorist over there. So anyone can just take a ticket and come to the United States or travel internally inside Europe. So this issue need to be dealt with.

He is the editor of the NewYorker.com Nick, good to see you. I know there in the U.S. online tracking is on the radar in a big way at the FTC and of the U.S. Congress. I personally don't want my every move tracked online, but is government intervention the answer?\",\n",
      "            \"Government intervention is actually pretty hard and pretty complicated, because the technology develops very quickly and government tends to move very slow. Legislation passes through congress at a very slow rate. So it's hard for government to respond to specific concerns. What the FTC can do is they can put specific restrictions on specific companies. They can certain deals, like they've done with Facebook. They can crack down hard when there's a violation. And they can set out a -- you know, a series of principles which companies have to follow, or sort of set of best practices that consumers can be aware of. So the FTC can and should do all of that, but government intervention on this stuff is actually pretty complicated.\",\n",
      "            \"And what about the ad industry itself? Can it control itself as it collects more information about us?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, the ad industry has incentives to regulate itself, right. The ad industry doesn't want to get called out. They don't want to have something bad happen. You don't want to be known as the company that revealed this terrible thing to somebody else. So they do have incentives to self-regulate, but they also have vastly more incentives to try to gather as much information and to do as much of it as they possibly can. There is an arms race between the companies, who can gather more data? Data is power. So the more data you can get, the better the ads you can serve. So self regulation is going to be -- it's not likely to work that well.\",\n",

      "            \"Well, for one, I don't think it's -- it's not quite as apocalyptic as some people feel. So a lot of this tracking is, you know, I -- you know, messed up my registration for the New York City Marathon so I was Googling ways to try to get in and started getting served as on special ways to get in the New York Marathon. That's actually useful. So a lot of the ads that come up are useful. If you're pregnant and you've told everybody it's useful to get deals on Pampers. So you don't have to worry that much about all of it. But there are lots of things you can do to the extent you are worried. So you can set up -- you can browse in incognito mode on your browser, then information isn't collected about you. You can disable, as you say, third party cookies on your browser. Every browser has a preference for that. Two things that I think are important that most people don't know is that I turn off the preferences in my phone in the settings over the different apps and services that track my location. That kind of weirds me out. There are a lot of settings and a lot of ways you can do that.

We now have the latest figures of more than 120 people missing. Earlier, though, authorities were saying they had an exact number. They were saying 141 people were missing. So why those numbers got revised downwards, we're not sure. But, of course, that can only mean one of two things. People were either saved and brought out of the rubble or they did find certain individuals living in this village dead as a result of this landslide. We're not sure. The state broadcaster, CCTV, did not say how they came to these new figures. But it is not going to be surprising if this does turn into a recovery operation at some point because, as you can see with these pictures, this was a massive landslide that took out 46 homes in a matter of seconds. There were witnesses on the scene who spoke to state media, who said that it came down with an incredibly sudden rush of force and that they were able to do nothing before it happened. So what's happening now, is rescuers, they've grown. Their numbers have grown throughout the day. There are now nearly 800 people there helping in that rescue situation. But they face an enormous challenge, given the amount of debris. And we're also told through state media reporting that a second smaller landslide was not very far away from this. One actually blocked a portion of the road and it's making it difficult for rescue crews to get their equipment in there. It is also scheduled to rain over the next couple of days and you can expect this operation will last for several days. So even though there is ongoing rescue efforts, even though there is still hope that there will be more survivors found, these rescue operations face an uphill battle moving forward.\",\n",

We are seeing more suburbs in the north being submerged in water and more neighborhoods are having to be evacuated. Also, the Don Mueang domestic airport in Bangkok is starting to be surrounded by water, a meter of water in some areas there. Now, we have about 3,500 people that we've seen in tiny tents within the domestic airport, in the departures and the arrivals area. Authorities say that they won't be moving those evacuees anywhere, they are safe on the higher levels. But, ironically, this airport is also where the flood relief operations command is headquartered. They're considering whether or not they have to move out to try and keep the headquarters dry. Now, while water further north, we're being told by authorities, is actually starting to recede from the northern parts of Thailand, within Bangkok itself, the waters are still rising. The Chao Phraya River, which runs through the capital, is still rising. The next focus for authorities is next weekend and into early next week, when the high tides come back once again. Obviously, that will hamper some of the water flowing through the canals and through the rivers into the sea. As for time lines, we have been told by authorities they believe that it will be at least two weeks before we can see the situation start to improve.

      "            \"Here's what's happening right \\\"Now In The News.\\\" Two missing boys enjoy their first full day back with their families. One boy had been missing since Monday, the other since October of 2002. They were rescued from a suburban St. Louis apartment yesterday. A suspect is in custody. A winter storm crippling the nation's mid-section -- snow and freezing rain, icy roads, power outages, all of that. The Associated Press reports at least six deaths on ice-covered roads in Oklahoma and Missouri, all the result of traffic accidents. Air travel is also seriously affected and more icy weather is expected. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is in Jerusalem. It's the first stop on a Middle East tour to push the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and to persuade governments in the region to support President Bush's plan to send more U.S. troops to Iraq. President Bush has been talking with Republican congressional leaders at Camp David this weekend. In his weekly radio address the president acknowledged congressional skepticism about his plan to increase troop levels in Iraq. He said those who criticize the plan should come up with a better idea. And you're looking at live pictures right now out of North Carolina where we're awaiting a press conference to begin involving the North Carolina State Attorney General's Office, all involving the Duke lacrosse case -- that very controversial case. We've heard recently that the prosecutor is asking to recuse himself from the case. Perhaps we'll hear some answers today from the state attorney's office -- State Attorney General's Office on that request. From Texas to Illinois, a big winter storm has much of the U.S. mid-section in its icy grips. I've been telling you about that. Look at some of the pictures that we're seeing now out of Missouri. The first wave of the storm moved through. Ice-coated roads and power lines are causing some pretty big problems, and thousands of people across the region lost power when the storm blew in. Pretty similar situation in Oklahoma. Look at those pictures. Work crews are out in force this weekend trying to keep the highways passable. The power went out in parts of that state as ice-coated trees and power lines came tumbling down. And in Austin, Texas, liquid trouble of a different sort -- so much rain lately, rivers and streams there are on the rise. Let's check in with Bonnie Schneider who is keeping a close tab on all of that -- Bonnie.\",\n",
      "            \"All right, thank you so much, Bonnie. Meantime, we want to take you straight to North Carolina there, where the North Carolina State Attorney General's Office is holding a press conference as it relates to the lacrosse -- the Duke team.\",\n",
      "            \"Thank you very much. Today I've directed our prosecutors in the Attorney General's Office to accept the request of the Durham district attorney to take over the three Durham cases. What this means is that our office will now serve as the prosecutor for the state of North Carolina in these three cases. This work will be handled by our special prosecutions section here in the Attorney General's Office. This section is available to all district attorneys in the state when there's a conflict or when there are other issues that prevent district attorneys from handling a case. Next week we'll transfer all of the files and documents in this case from the Durham District Attorney's Office to our office. Our prosecutors, as we always do, will conduct a fair, impartial and thorough review of these matters. Agreeing to accept the prosecution of these cases doesn't guarantee a trial, nor does it suggest a dismissal. It simply promises a fresh and thorough review of the facts and a decision on the best way to handle these cases. During the review it's possible that we would need to request additional information to conduct further investigation or recheck information that's already been included in the court file. I anticipate that our prosecutors will seek to meet with witnesses, with investigators and with defense attorneys. Now I wish I could tell you that this case would be resolved quickly, but it's my understanding that there are numerous documents and other information in the district attorney's files and in the court record. Since we have not been involved in the investigation or the prosecution of these cases, all of the information will be new to our office. Any case with such serious criminal charges requires a careful and deliberate review. Now, our goal is to seek justice and truth while respecting the rights of everyone involved. We accept these cases with our eyes wide open to the evidence but with blinders on to all other distractions. In the final analysis the path that these cases travel will be lighted by the law and the evidence alone. Now, as with any criminal case, except during the court proceedings, we cannot discuss the details of this case or any of these cases, nor can we comment on the process that has brought the cases to this point. What I can do is I will try to answer your questions now about how the process will go forward. So we'll go ahead and begin with those questions. I'll be glad to take them.\",\n",

I believe that other attorneys could be involved in the process, but right now I've assigned those two attorneys to handle these cases. It's too early to tell about the February hearing. We are just getting the information over. Clearly it's important that we take time to review matters thoroughly. Of course, it's up to Judge Smith to schedule hearing dates, but I would assume that as soon as we gather the information and have a chance to look it over, we will want to shortly meet with Judge Smith to discuss scheduling issues and other issues as we proceed.\",\n",

      "            \"Well, we'll handle the cases the way we handle all of these cases. Our special prosecution section often gets tough cases, cases that district attorneys are finding too hot to handle or cases where they have conflicts. We will handle it the same way where we will review the evidence impartially, and we will move forward. It was only just yesterday that the Durham district attorney called Mr. Coeman in our office and then sent his request that we take over the case. We have quickly considered it because we think it's important to go ahead and move quickly in this case, and we have accepted the case.\",\n",

Our legal guys, Avery Friedman, a civil rights attorney and law professor joining us from Cleveland, and Richard Herman, New York criminal defense attorney, joining us from New York. Good to see both of you.\",\n",

Did you see this coming or does it still come as much of a surprise that he would request being recused when all along he was quite adamant that he felt strongly about where he was going with the case?\",\n",
      "            \"Fred, he's obviously sought some independent counsel who is halfway intelligent who advised him that based upon the ethics -- alleged ethics violations and those proceedings, he really has a major conflict and he's really taken away the focus of the case and put it on himself as opposed to the case. So he really -- this is probably, you know, the most intelligent thing he's done since he's gotten this case from the inception but like John Mellencamp said, that song \\\"And the Walls Come Tumbling Down,\\\" this is the beginning of the end for this guy. I'm telling you, Fred, this guy is in big trouble and this case is over. There is no way it's going to trial.\",\n",
      "            \"Really. OK, so the ripple effect. You think the case is over. So, Richard, do you see this -- I'm sorry, Avery, do you see this the same way? Is it a precursor for dropping the charges altogether?\",\n",
      "            \"I actually think that's what's going to happen, Fredricka. But I think -- I love the idea where you have an independent body talking about the path of justice being lighted by the law. Obviously, they took time to prepare this for the press conference -- for the briefing, but the truth is when prosecutors, at least from a prosecutorial perspective, talk about a fresh analysis, they are going to look at everything, and I think Roy Cooper was very clear. This doesn't mean a dismissal. It doesn't mean a prosecution, so from the standpoint of really doing justice, whether or not this case goes away -- and I think it probably will -- the idea that the government protecting the rights of the public will examine the facts anew, and I think that really restores faith in the integrity of the process.\",\n",
      "            \"So I wonder, Avery, if one reads between the lines, while the attorney general said it doesn't necessarily mean that we're ending the case nor does it mean we're advancing the case, at the same time does it sort of say that, you know what? We as a body have made some serious mistakes and this is our opportunity to try to correct them now and that, too, might be rather damaging in terms of public opinion there?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, that has no reflection on the attorney general's office. I mean, Mike Nifong has messed this case up. No one really disputes that. No one seriously challenges that. I think what's very healthy here is that as Americans when we look to the process and we look for due process and fairness, the fact is there's a fallback, and in this case, North Carolina law provides that a local district attorney can go to the attorney general's office. That's what's happening, so I think any discouragement about how people look at system is really neutralized by the involvement of the attorney general.\",\n",

      "            \"Yes.\",\n",
      "            \"And if they truly are going to do that, Fred, this case will be dismissed.\",\n",
      "            \"Really? Even though he did say there were files that none of his prosecutors had had their hands on yet, it will be new to them?\",\n",
      "            \"Fred, this is not a sophisticated case. It's really pretty open and shut. Once they read the 168 different versions of what the alleged victim said, I mean, the case is over. There's no evidence at all, Fred, zero evidence here that's credible.\",\n",
      "            \"All right.\",\n",
      "            \"One point -- one quick point.\",\n",

You're not going anywhere though because one case that is now fairly new when you're dealing about prosecution, what challenges might prosecutors face as they make their case against this man accused of kidnapping two Missouri boys?

      "            \"The shooting death of an NBA star's cousin has drawn fresh attention to U.S. gun violence. Nykea Aldridge was shot in the head in Chicago on Friday while pushing her infant in a stroller. She was the cousin of 12-time NBA all-star Dwyane Wade. Aldridge was an innocent victim in the wrong place at the wrong time when police say a dispute led to gunfire. Wade has been an outspoken critic of gun violence and took to Twitter to mourn. He said, \\\"My cousin was killed today in Chicago, another act of senseless gun violence. Four kids lost their mom for no reason. Unreal.\\\" At least 455 people have been shot to death in Chicago in the first seven-and-a-half months of this year, that's according to the Chicago Tribune newspaper which has been tracking every homicide in the city. Nykea Aldridge's death has become a talking point in the U.S. presidential election as issues of gun violence and race take center stage. Republican Donald Trump is reaching out to minority voters now with an emphasis on economic growth, but he's also citing the violence in U.S. inner cities as a reason why African Americans should vote for him. Saturday, he tweeted about the shooting death of the NBA star's cousin, and the possible effect on his campaign saying Dwyane Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying, African-Americans will vote Trump. Many of Trump's opponents have criticized his response to Aldridge's death. Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine told reporters in Florida a different response was needed.\",\n",

That's the only -- that's the only reaction that's appropriate right now, and maybe a sadness about this gun violence issue, which we know it's complicated. But that is -- you're seeing something like this, and it's just we should redouble our efforts to really adopt and promote smart strategies on that. Just the sympathy issue is the one that that oughta to be our strong, first reaction.\",\n",
      "            \"On top of backlash over Trump's tweets, one of his top aides is under fire for alleged antisemitism, the ex-wife of new Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon claimed that in 2007, he didn't want his daughters attending a school because of the number of Jews who attended. Dianne Gallagher has that story.\",\n",
      "            \"It is important to note that those charges of antisemitism do come from his now ex-wife during a child custody case back in 2007. Now she said in a court statement that Bannon did not want his daughters to attend a certain girls' school that they were considering due to the number of Jewish students. Now the documents show her stating \\\"he says he doesn't like Jews and that he doesn't like that they raise their kids to be whiny brats, and that he didn't want the girls going to school with Jews\\\". Now again, these are his now ex-wife's words from a court declaration involving a dispute over child support. CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign, we haven't heard back from them just yet, but Bannon's spokeswoman tells us that \\\"at the time, Mr. Bannon never said anything like that, and proudly sent the girls to Archer for their middle school and high school education.\\\" Of course all of this does come as the newly-appointed campaign CEO is already facing scrutiny about his background. We learned this week just that 20 years ago, Bannon faced multiple charges, including misdemeanor domestic violence, stemming from an incident involving his ex-wife. Now those charges were eventually dismissed because his ex-wife didn't show up to court. She said later that it's because Bannon's attorney threatened her saying she wouldn't be able to support her children if she did. That is a charge that that attorney has denied. Of course it is just another chapter in what has been a very controversial career for Steve Bannon.\",\n",

And you just think that you're minding your own business driving through an underpass, getting across a very busy part of the Turkish capital, Ankara, and then all of a sudden water starts to fill up underneath you. One of the drivers actually said that when he drove into the tunnel, 5 to 10 centimeters of water on the ground, something we don't recommend doing, because you never know how deep it actually is, but within minutes, if not seconds, the water rose almost to the roofs of the cars. Firemen had to race against time to rescue passengers who remained stranded in their vehicles, including children and some of the elderly as well. That deluge occurred very, very quickly, and dumped a considerable amount of rainfall into the Turkish capital. Scary moments as you can imagine. Now the other big story across Europe is the excessive heat that has been boiling the western parts of the continent. Look at this in Lyons, France. The mercury in the thermometer climbing all the way to 40 degrees. The good news is there is some relief in sight, but the heat continues to shift a little further to the east, so Berlin, yeah, a scorcher today, 34, mostly sunny, but look what's coming to you to start off the work week tomorrow, 23 degrees, and it's all thanks to a cold front that's passing through the region. That is going to cool our temperatures for Paris as well, and we'll get a respite from the extreme heat. So that pushes to the south and east, there's a cooler weather indicated with that shading of green, and then London starts to get into the milder temperatures as we head into the first parts of the work week. Warsaw also starting to cool off, the capital of Poland. Let me give you a quick update from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. This is the western Pacific, there's Japan to the north, China to the west. Sustained winds of Typhoon Lionrock now at 205 kilometers per hour. This is equivalent to a strong category 3 nearly teetering on a weak category four Atlantic hurricane. A very defined eye with the storm system, we are monitoring it very closely because all of our computer models still have it making that northwesterly turn towards the mainland of Japan, and look at that, Tokyo and Sendai in the middle of that path of uncertainty for about three days out, so they need to be well aware of what is potentially coming their way.\",\n",

Also, welcome to day two of the latest security alert proclaimed by the bush administration. Homeland security czar Tom Ridge tried today to explain the alert announced last time by Attorney General John Ashcroft. Governor Ridge said it was just a reiteration of the last alert, issued back an October 10. But he added that Americans should continue to live their lives, to be Americans. George W. Bush took that advice, going to the Bronx tonight for the World Series game. But the Federal Aviation Administration prohibited all traffic -- all air traffic within 30 miles of New York's JFK Airport for all series games at Yankee Stadium. And Dick Cheney squirrelled away into one of his vice presidential hiding places. Does all this reassure Americans or make them very, nervous? We are asking two members of Congress: Democrat Gary Ackerman of New York and Republican Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, chairman of the Terrorism Subcommittee. Bill Press.\",\n",

Congressman, so if there was any confusion over what the attorney general said last the night, I thought that the homeland security czar today just cleared everything up. Now with full tongue in cheek, let's listen to what Tom Ridge had to say, how he explained it all.\",\n",
      "            \"All we are saying with the general alert is, continue to live your lives, continue to be America, but be aware. Be alert. Be on guard.\",\n",

      "            \"Well, what people -- what people have got to do is to understand that it is a different day. It is a different time where we are subject to terrorist attack like we have never been subject to it before. And those of us been involved in the world of terrorism for the last five or six years have been saying, day in and day out, you know, that there is a potential for this to happen. You ought to know about this. The profile of it was not raised until September 11. Because that profile was raised on September 11, people now, I think, need to expect to know when something is -- the potential for something is imminent. It may not happen -- probably isn't going to happen -- but folks need to be aware that it could happen.\",\n",
      "            \"But here is the problem that I see. I don't know whether the attorney general or you know what kind of confusion you are sowing among the American people. I mean, people, I think -- we know now that we are vulnerable. We know the enormity of what happened. We know it can happen again. But at the same time, people are trying, you know, to get on. And every time they try to get on, Ashcroft comes out and says a terrorist could strike this weekend.\",\n",
      "            \"The problem with it is, though, if the FBI, the CIA -- any law enforcement agency -- has some information -- direct information about the fact that there may be a terrorist attack that is imminent and they don't tell the American people and we have a tragic incident that then the press gets a hold of and says, \\\"Hey, why didn't you tell us?\\\" So I think they're erring on the side of caution. You know, I think, you know, Gary's district and my district are two entirely situations. In my district, for example, we have had no phone calls as a result of the alert we went on yesterday. My guess is in his district he has had a bunch of them. And it's the nature of the beast, because he's -- represents the World Trade Center.\",\n",

The intelligence people working on the data found the same patterns -- maybe patterns of traffic, maybe the patterns of activity existing -- that preceded the previous terrorist incidents. Surely that is sufficient reason to alert the American people, isn't it?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I don't -- I don't think we really know what happened. And what we have here is sort of a heterogeneous approach to spreading information. The message is mixed. And -- the explanation is even more confusing. You've -- you have somebody appointed to be the domestic terrorism czar. He doesn't make the initial announcement. The attorney general instead makes the initial announcement, and he says there's reason to believe there's specific threat...\",\n",

So everybody -- is heightened for this and then all of a sudden you have the other head of the organization come out and say, \\\"Well, this is really just a continuation of what happened on the 11th. It's the same general kind of...\\\" Now which is it? We should be alert all the time or there's a specific alert for this week? The American people are very, confused by this and it's very frustrating.\",\n",
      "            \"But let me show you something else that Governor Ridge said. Let's just take a -- take a look at it please.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, we will never know if the country going on alert heightening security, thwarted or frustrated an attempt by somebody or some individuals within this country to bring harm or terror to a community or to a region.\",\n",
      "            \"What he is talking about is the alert of October 11th. He's saying that possibly going on alert prevented a terrorist incident. Are you ready to gainsay that and say that is a lot of baloney, John.\",\n",
      "            \"We don't know, and there is no information to back this up. And you know -- you are never going to know. It is -- it is basically self-inoculation to say, \\\"Well, I'm making this announcement. And if nothing happens here I'm a hero, because I prevented it from happening.\\\" Or if something does happen, you are able to say, \\\"See, I told you.\\\" But nobody told us what we are supposed to do. And that's the problem. The administration is boxed in. I don't think they should keep this information from the American people, but there should be plan here. And there is no plan. We've always been prepared for a two-front war. Fighting a war on two fronts. Unfortunately, one of the fronts was not in the United States. And that is really our heavyweight problem.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I agree -- disagree, rather -- with my friend Gary Ackerman. But in fact President Bush did tell us what to do and he did tell us what to look for. You'll remember this, Congressman. On October 11th, after the first warning at his prime time news conference, a reporter asked the president what should we be looking for. And here what's he told the American people.\",\n",

And that is that listen, because we are living in a different world today, the American people have to be more cognizant of what is going on around them than ever before. If they see something strange, then by golly don't just drive on down the street. Pick up your phone and call the police and say, \\\"Hey, there may be nothing to this, but...\\\" And, you know, the law enforcement folks know how to filter that out and decide what is what and what is not what.\",\n",

You know, my mother-in-law bought the thing hook line and sinker. Go out and go shopping. And God bless her, you know? This is the normal.

So, you know, the vice president -- in the event that something happens to the president, we know that he succeeds him -- and he has got to be protected, he has got to be in place.

This came out in the hearing that we had yesterday in New York City. Mayor Giuliani made the point that one problem we have between federal, state and local law enforcement officers is the fact that we don't have enough information sharing. Some of it is prohibited by statute. But this goes a little bit beyond that. But this does illustrate the fact that there needs to be sharing of information between federal, state and local folks.

He said, quote, \\\"Being told to turn on CNN or CNBC doesn't seem to be the best way to communicate what law enforcement ought to know. Having one more breathless announcement with absolutely no or little substance is not terribly helpful.\\\" End quote. And this isn't a silly pundit. This is a cop in a city where I think they would -- they should be in on the know. If he has to watch us on CNN -- or watch CNN to find out what the alert is, something is not working. Isn't that right, Mr. Chairman?\",\n",
      "            \"Bob, you have always told me to keep up with you, that you did know everything. But no, that is a problem. It's a problem sharing that information with 18,000 law enforcement agencies. And to go little bit further, what Giuliani said yesterday -- and he is right -- there has got to be a level at which that information sharing stops. The question is, where should it stop and how much should be told? And I think that is the problem here. I mean, I think certainly if there more specifics known -- New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, wherever -- they would have known about it, obviously.\",\n",
      "            \"Let me -- let me pursue that. I was on phone calling -- since I was going to be on this program -- and I was calling a few other police chiefs I know. And I found that some of them also got the word after it was announced to the nation and none of them had any details at all. They didn't say, \\\"Guard the bridge\\\" or \\\"Guard the power station.\\\" They just said be on your alert, be prepared. That's a Boy Scout motto, too. But it isn't adequate for cops. As chairman, is this the way to do that?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, what has happened since September 11th, there have been certain specific entities, certain national treasures and other specific places that have been identified. The local law enforcement officials know where they are. They know where the power plants are. They know where the dams, the key bridges or whatever. And they have -- they know where they are.\",\n",
      "            \"Just one final point of why this might have been good idea last night. You know there's this show \\\"America's Most Wanted.\\\" John Walsh, right? They've got tons of crimes that are never solved by law enforcement officials no matter how many years they investigate it, but they are solved because some citizen sees something weird -- somebody at a 7/11 or something, or a nearby refinery or -- and -- and calls it in. Now, why -- so why doesn't it make sense by this kind of warning to enlist the American people to keep your eyes open and report anything suspicious?\",\n",
      "            \"It's a great idea and it works when you hold the poster up. But nobody is going to turn Bin Laden in because he is not running around in any American city that we know. The problem is, they're telling us, \\\"Turn somebody in.\\\" And you're going to turn in the owner of your local 7/11 because more than likely he comes from the Middle East, because that's who buys the franchise. But we don't know what we are looking for. That's going to cause a major panic. We are all going to -- we are all going to become paranoid and look at each other and get suspicious.

According to these Harvard researchers, more than 4,600 people died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, and they say that's a conservative estimate. Let me say that all again. More than 4,600 people dead. For the record, the island's official death toll stands at 64. Researchers say many of the deaths were due in part to power outages that affected medical care and other services. I have with me Bethenny Frankel. You know her from \\\"The Real Housewives of New York.\\\" She is the founder of Skinny Girl. But she has chartered all of these planes full of supplies to bring to victims of the national disaster. This was before Trump and FEMA got to the island. She had a suitcase with 100,000 gift cards and raised more than $300,000 through her foundation, Be Strong. Watch this.\",\n",

In the beginning I tweeted they were saying there were 17 deaths. I had seen people in excess of a hundred who were dying. And we've sent 50 million in relief and when we were there, I was sending patients home. So every plane that went there filled with relief, patients, sick people who were dying, were coming home. And we were in the mountains where people couldn't get to, people who were ankle deep in mud, people today still have no electricity, the elderly have no dialysis --\",\n",

      "            \"After helping in Houston and then in Mexico after the earthquake, I realized I had a skill set. And Puerto Rico was the most challenging because people were telling me you can't go because they have no water or electricity. And I said I have to go. This was before Trump went there. When you do something and lead, that's when people jump in, that's how we got the cargo, that's how we amassed the airplanes and that's how we raised $1.1 million in cash. It was $1.1 million in cash that goes directly into people's hands.\",\n",
      "            \"Why was that so important that you gave them cash? It's my understanding you really care about rebuilding the communities, putting money back in these local economies that have been so totally devastated.\",\n",
      "            \"In the beginning, people need water, rice, beans, the medicine, the respirators and the solar power. People are spending a thousand dollars a month to get their electricity on to get their dialysis. The reason for the cash is, a, dignity. They know what they need. They could need water, insulin, diaper, a thermometer. They know. And lastly, to pump money into the economy. It needs to be rebuilt. And not every inch of the island looks like that. So many places do. There was still power outages when I was there two weeks ago. People see San Juan and think it working.\",\n",
      "            \"You've been there six or seven times. Have you seen improvements?\",\n",

Places in the mountains, people have no homes, their kids are depressed, dogs without legs. It's a very bad situation. It has never not been a crisis. And this is going to be another hurricane season that's supposed to be worse. So people need to lock their doors before they get robbed and people need to know who they're investing their money in to give directly to people. So much corruption.\",\n",

People in Puerto Rico, they're very family centric and they will have nothing and be living in mud and have rats and they'll be loving because they're with their family. They have fortitude, we're strong, we're not giving up. The power goes out, they make it like it's nothing. And they're not complainers. They're very honest. We would go to the house and give a cash card and, by accident, go again and they say, you already gave me one, give it to that person. So they have an amazing spirit, but they're being kicked like dogs and it's time for them to finally get a little break. Now with this hurricane season, they might not get that break.\",\n",

      "            \"Right. And he's at this point - basically gone crazy. He thinks fluoride is turning everyone into communists in America because they placed it in the water, which I think was a popular theory in the 1950s.\",\n",

And it just struck me as how, today, we've got all these generals in power who are actually politicians. And when we were talking about the problems with North Korea, it just showed me how things change but how they remain the same. And so, yeah, I thought it was just right on the money.\",\n",

      "            \"This is true. But the first time - it was like, I thought this was supposed to be a comedy. And at first, I was kind of reading it straight. I was like, this actually seems like a totally plausible thing that could happen - that a general goes crazy and sends a bomber off to, like, you know, attack Russia. I finally got the comedy of it.

Phoebe Marr is an Iraq scholar, a retired senior fellow at the National Defense University here in Washington, knows a lot about this subject. Thanks for joining us. Is that realistic, that Saddam Hussein might be removed from power relatively easily with some uprising, a coup, some colonel or general simply taking a shot at him?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I don't see Saddam fading from history. I think when Saddam goes, it's going to be with a bang and certainly not with a whimper. There have been plenty of attempts to remove him. Attempted coups. Of course after the Gulf War in 1991 there was a substantial uprising, Kurds in the north, Shia in the south. None of those have been successful, so I don't think we have any reason think it's going to be easy.\",\n",

      "            \"Well, first of all, strange though it may seem, his modified constitution requires him to run every six years and so he's going to do it. The point -- there are several other points, however. One is to prove to everybody that he is supported by his population. There may also be a point in sort of smoking out any opposition, obviously people are going to be expected to show up at the ballot box, we know how they're expected to vote. Should anybody not show up, not vote, there would be consequences. So...\",\n",

      "            \"That's very true, but there are certainly pockets of -- not only pockets, but plenty of opposition, I understand his posters are being defaced in country and so on. So we certainly do expect a 99, maybe even 100% vote, he's aiming for. But nevertheless, this is a message to his population as well as the outside world: Don't even think about defecting; don't even think about staying home.\",\n",

But people are worried about a war, they're worried about the uncertainty of what happens after Saddam, a potential instability and in short, the costs of replacing him. And it's that fear that holds them back.\",\n",

      "            \"I think that's very unlikely. You'll remember they fought a very bitter and bloody eight year war between 1980 and 1988, There are no good feelings between the two populations. And there's a fear in Iraq of a much larger Iran, and there is, of course, the difference in ideology, one state religious, the other secular. So although there is a lot of talk about this kind of an alliance and it seems like they should both be against a so-called common adversary, that's very unlikely that they're going to get together.\",\n",

Elise Labott, CNN's Global Affairs Correspondent she is here for us and Hillary Mann Leverette, the co-author of \\\"Going To Tehran\\\" she is also someone was negotiated with Iran when she works at the state department for two different administrations. It's good to have you both. Alise, the politics, the law surrounding this is very fuzzy. It's not a treaty. We know it's kind of a deal. Congress gets a say because they have the purse strings with the sanctions. But how do you see this going forward, assuming, let's assume a deal gets done.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, as you know, they blew past the 60 - the 30-day deadline that was July 9th, Chris. And so this means, the congress will have 60 days to review the deal. And, and basically, the administration said that they think a deal would stand 30 days or 60 days. But, I anticipate congress approving the deal. There will be a lot of talk, a lot of debate and criticism on both sides, I think. But in the end, I think, at this point, congress probably pose poise to accept a deal even though this deal is only as good as this administration, President Obama. A lot of that political candidates for 2016 on the Republican side have said they would possibly overturn the deal. So I think right now the goal is to get a deal in place and the hope is, if Iran will begin to implement it, then that could go a long way toward it being implemented in the future. Because the alternative is unthinkable.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, often times, a deal is only as good as the next deal, you know what I mean? So that's one reality they have to deal with both sides. One other question for you, Alise though, procedurally. Congress says no, we don't like the deal. They don't give them the vote. They vote it down. The president can veto it. What if they say we don't care, this isn't legislation. We are not giving money for the sanctions.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, there are certain sanctions that President Obama can wave in terms of executive authority.\",\n",
      "            \"But not all of them.\",\n",
      "            \"That's right but a lot of these sanctions are U.N. security council resolutions and then they will be lifted under those measures. I think the problem right here is, if the U.S. does not make good under their commitments under this agreement, then the whole sanctions regime of the international community falls apart.\",\n",
      "            \"There's that, I get that. But I'm just saying here, domestically, as they go through the approval process, that's congress' leverage and it's just interesting, Hillary, how this plays out on that side. Now, on the other side, OK, do you believe that you can have a deal where Iran will really allow the kinds of inspections that seem so important to members of congress here?\",\n",
      "            \"You know, the Iranians will call, what we will call inspections, the Iranians are going to call managed access. And if you look at their records both in terms of the nuclear issue allowing managed access to the atomic agency, it's been good. But even more impressive is their record with the chemical records treaty where they have allowed quite extensive managed access international inspectors going into even military sites. If you look at the record soberly without the demonization, their record is good. And I think there's a lot of reason to believe that an international agency can carry this out. They have done it in the chemical weapons field. They have been in Iran now for more than ten years on the nuclear issues.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. Hillary, people are thinking about Iran right now, and we usually skip over what you said. But I think today is worth engaging, the demonization that usually goes along with Iran. Is that wrong? Because the perspective here is, why do we need the deal? Because Iran is bad and you can't trust them they will create a nuclear weapon and try to kill people with it, maybe us. And you also need a deal because they are running rough shod in all this international situations there's a detriment of U.S. policy. You do not accept that. What's the other side?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. I mean, there's two reasons. One as I, I look at the case of United States and China. We came to terms with China, accepted the people's Republic of China which has enormously demonized in the United States. When I was a child you couldn't say People's Republic of China you could only refer to it as Red china. We came to terms with them not because they are a great country with a great record and have American beliefs but because, we needed the deal for ourselves to get out of the strategic platform Vietnam and never ending military interventions in Asia. We need a deal with Iran for the same reasons in the Middle East. We are on the trajectory of never ending unwinnable wars there. So we need it for our own interest like China, the system that they have built in Iran is born from a revolution. A revolution to give that country and its people real independence. Foreign policy independence especially. It's their system. They are going to morph it as they choose. And we have every interest to align with it. It is, today, the one stable political order in the Middle East and a strong one at that.\",\n",
      "            \"Wow what an irony here. Iran being the strong shoulder in the region. Just one quick button here. Assuming something gets done and it's just about time, they have 60 days. We are expecting a vote quickly. What do you think will be the major dynamic of opposition about that deal in congress?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I think the thing is that the deal is only as good as the dealers when you look at the breakout time, President Obama said after this deal is done, Iran's breakout time is almost zero. I think they want to dismantle Iran some nuclear infrastructure not just in place. I think that they want to make sure there's a quick snap back of sanctions if Iran violates but those are things that are going to be tricky. Because once this train gets going, Chris, I think it's going to be hard to put the sanctions back in place, who determines what a violation is. I think the critics of the deal want to make sure there's more permanent curves not temporary ones.\",\n",
      "            \"Alise, Hillary, thank you. Stand by. As we get word of a deal, we want to come back to figure out what it means. Alisyn?\",\n",
      "            \"OK. Chris, Senator Lindsey Graham calling Donald Trump a quote wrecking ball saying his comments on immigration threatens the future of the Republican party. We discuss that, next.\"\n",

We know four people have been charged with murder for causing the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Investigators named three Russians and a Ukrainian as suspects and said their trial will begin next year. But Russia and Ukraine refused to extradite their citizens. Here they are here. It's doubtful any of the accused will show up for trial. MH17 was shot down by a missile five years ago now over Ukraine, nearly 300 people were killed in that crash. Let's bring in Moscow bureau chief Nathan Hodge for more on all of this. Talk us through who the finger has been pointed at here.\",\n",

But they are saying that they did set off a chain of events that led to the deployment of that missile launcher, alleging that missile launcher was brought in from the Russian Federation into separatist held territory in response to ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive against insurgent forces in Ukraine's east at the time. They've laid it out, the investigators, in a very forensic fashion. They've presented today in a detailed press conference, everything including images of that rocket launcher as it was alleged to have been brought in from Russia, as it was spotted along the road by observers and private individuals, as well as overhead imagery. And intercepted phone calls, which they say support the case that these individuals, who were tied to Russia's security and intelligence, had asked for the extra support, the additional weaponry, that they wanted to take on or to put a dent in Ukraine's airpower at that time and the conflict. And then with the deployment of that weapons system, the rocket launcher, the boot shortly thereafter, that's what brought down the MH17, which was flying en route to Kuala Lumpur, Robyn.\",\n",

Four firefighters, U.S. Forest service firefighters, have been killed. A fifth is in critical condition. They are going to be working very, very hard today to protect any homes that might be in that area as this fire continues to grow and put those fire lines down. That's going to be about the only thing they can do, apparently, as you see that wind, Santa Ana wind, just cruising through the area to make it that much more difficult to control. Five percent contained right now, which is really not much to speak of. Thousands of firefighters going to be working on that again today. Also something to watch, the big board, as always.

What's more, they have your paperwork on file and that would streamline the refinancing process. But I've got to tell you, Tony, it pays to shop around, too. Start with bankrate.com or hsh.com, two websites that can give you comparisons on rates from individual banks in your area.

The high heat, which is on the way, and more winds throughout the afternoon. And you might be able to see that's very complicated terrain, even for the thousands of firefighters working this.

We knew that Idyllwild, which is kind of to the east of the fire yesterday, was probably in danger for a while. But because the wind actually had an easterly component, it was blowing from the northeast to the southwest, Idyllwild actually got spared quite a bit. But, you know, you don't know whether this was actually someone's home, was it a camp. We think there will be - we're seeing some vehicles around this building as well. There are many out buildings around. The whole problem with it today is that, obviously, the fire is still going and the winds have not slowed down. So, the threat today is when we get past this mountain area, this San Bernardino Mountain area, and we get into the San Jacinto area. And what happens when you get sparks on top of a mountain like this. And although San Jacinto and -- have it all the way back down in the valley, you can actually get these little fire balls that will fire at least a half mile ahead of the fire line, especially from a ridge line there, and actually jump the fire ahead and ahead and ahead. And that's what the firefighters are seeing now. So, you're trying to fight one fire, and you're on one side of the fire line, and you look up, and all of a sudden, there's another fire ahead of you. That's why it's so very dangerous now today, especially when you get into some of these structures.

And so now not only are you getting tinder dry air and tinder dry vegetation to burn, but now you've got sparks off of a major fire there in a building, in a structure. That spark will go much farther than, let's say, a dry leaf or a dry stick. Now you have shingles and things that are flying in the air, sparks that will go much farther. And as the winds pick up, it's that threshold, 15 to 25 miles per hour, that will push the fire ahead.

      "            \"Hello, Judy. Here is the order in judgment just received now. It's a stay -- it's a denial of the stay. It says that Judge Matsch of the U.S. District Court denied a stay of execution, and in fact this court agrees with that. The court says that it has denied a stay of execution for Timothy McVeigh, this court has been reviewing this brief, three judges on this panel for more than seven hours this date after it was filed first thing in the morning. And then the next step would be for Timothy McVeigh's lawyers to move on to the U.S. Supreme Court if in fact Timothy McVeigh wants to do that. We do know that McVeigh's lawyers have been working on their brief already for the U.S. Supreme Court. In fact, that highest court of the land has a copy of the FBI records that are in dispute, already in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court. So now, that an attorney will recall, one of the lawyers is already in Terre Haute, Indiana, has already visited with Timothy McVeigh this day, and now, that he will be receiving this news shortly. And also, that lawyer will make his way most likely over to the prison -- that was the plan anyway -- to brief Timothy McVeigh personally and find out exactly whether he wants to go to the highest court of the land -- Judy?\",\n",
      "            \"Susan, refresh us, if you will, on the reasons that the federal district judge, Judge Richard Matsch gave for initially turning down McVeigh's attorneys' request for a stay?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, the reason that Judge Matsch turned down his original request for a stay of execution is that in the view of Judge Matsch, he felt that the attorneys had had enough time to review the materials, he himself reviewed the FBI documents in record. And the judge said, that the evidence was so overwhelming against Timothy McVeigh, and that because he himself had admitted guilt in the Oklahoma City bombing, the judge felt as though, even if you considered all of these additional FBI documents, that no reasonable juror would change their mind when it came to deciding on a death sentence: life or death for Timothy McVeigh. The judge said that all of the additional information simply wouldn't have mattered, So the defense attorneys appealed that decision, saying that, your honors, before this court, we simply didn't have enough time, and it's not fair for you not to give us enough time to review all these materials and present a case before the court. But evidently, the three judges on the Circuit Court of Appeals agree with Judge Matsch, and has upheld his decision. And we might also point out that this court has never reversed one of Judge Matsch's decisions in the past.\",\n",
      "            \"Susan, how could there be such a discrepancy between McVeigh's attorneys saying they haven't had time to go through these documents, and then Judge Matsch, the Federal District Judge, and now the Appeals Court judges apparently saying they've looked at it all, and there's not enough there to change anything?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, that is a question for the judges to elaborate upon, and so far we haven't had a chance to read this order. We do know that Judge Matsch felt as though, from his review of the documents, obviously he has a different opinion than the defense attorneys do. They felt as though -- and they tried to make this argument to the court -- that in looking at these documents for 30 days, they wanted to have more time to interview some of the witnesses mentioned in the reports. Judge Matsch, after looking at their names, apparently wasn't impressed by that, and that's why he ruled the way that he did.\",\n",
      "            \"And Susan, you said earlier that McVeigh's attorneys have already started putting together their appeal to the United States Supreme Court. Does that mean that they anticipated losing here in the Federal Appeals Court in Denver?\",\n",
      "            \"I think what it means, Judy, is that is what any lawyer would do. They don't wait until the last possible moment to put together their briefs. They must prepare for any eventuality. And so it is one of those lawyers, Richard Burr, who has been working on this aspect of the case. And frankly, he told me late last night, after their brief that was presented this morning was finished, that he intend, if they lost here, to go back to Houston to put the finishing touched on the brief, and that that brief would be delivered by someone else in Washington to the U.S. Supreme Court if Timothy McVeigh agrees that that's what he wants to do. And quite frankly, some of his former defense attorneys have said that they're not sure what Timothy McVeigh will do. You know, he has these options before him, but they said they could also foresee a scenario where he might want to give himself enough time to prepare himself for Monday's execution, and might not want to proceed. But president ultimate decision, of course, is with him.\",\n",

      "            \"No, I was just going to say, above and beyond that, we haven't really had a time to study this order. It was literally just handed to us. So we hope to learn more details it after reading the material in its entirety.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, Susan, we can appreciate that, and we want to give you time to do that. Just to reiterate to our audience: Susan was just handed the documents, along with others there at the Federal Appeals Court in Denver. The -- three of the judges on that appeals court have decided to deny the request by Timothy McVeigh's attorneys that his execution be stayed, be delayed. In doing so, these appeals court judges are upholding the decision by a lower federal district judge, Judge Richard Matsch, who ruled just a matter of days ago that the execution should go ahead, that despite this new flood, if you will, of documents that the FBI just turned over years after the McVeigh trial -- despite these new documents, there was nothing in there that, in effect, would change the guilt, in their view, of Timothy McVeigh. Joining us now, our Supreme Court correspondent -- Washington correspondent Charles Bierbauer. Charles, if McVeigh's attorneys go ahead and appeal to the Supreme Court, what are the procedures there? What can we expect there?\",\n",
      "            \"The procedures are pretty well spelled out. The appeal would go initially to Justice Stephen Breyer, who bears the oversight responsibility for the 10th Circuit Court. Each of the justices is assigned certain circuits. Justice Breyer could act on his own to grant or deny a stay, but because of the prominence of this particular case, Justice Breyer is certain to circle -- circulate the petition to all of the justices. They do not have to actually meet; they can confer by phone. He would take a poll of the justices. It would require five of the justices to agree to a stay for a stay to be granted for Mr. McVeigh. They are certainly cognizant of the timetable under which they are working. There are certain criteria laid out under which a stay may be granted, and spelled out in the order -- in the rules of the court. One is that there is a reasonable probability of a review. That is to say, not just of this current petition, but of a review of the whole trial and sentencing. Two: that there is a fair prospect that the decision would be found to be erroneous. Three: that there would be irreparable harm from denying a stay. And fourth: a kind of balancing test that takes into consideration the interests of the public at large. So those are the criteria that Justice Breyer and his colleagues would have to consider. They can work through the weekend of course, too. We do not have a sense of timing at this point -- Judy.\",\n",
      "            \"So, Charles, just quickly, you're saying those criteria are different from the ones that have been used by the appeals court judges and the district judge -- federal district judge?\",\n",
      "            \"No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying that those are the criteria spelled out in the procedures for the court -- things that a justice would take into consideration. Obviously, they will take into consideration all that pertains to the law here -- excuse me -- and will start with Judge Matsch's ruling. And certainly the track record is such that, if the district judge, Judge Matsch, and the circuit courts deny the appeal, it's a very slim probability that the Supreme Court itself would grant a stay at this point.\",\n",
      "            \"All right. We're talking with Charles Bierbauer here in our studio. Also joining us in the Washington studio, CNN's justice correspondent Kelli Arena. Kelli, this has to be considered good news for the Justice Department who, after all, have been pushing the -- for the execution of Timothy McVeigh on time.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, that's right, Judy. All along, as you know, Justice has said that there's nothing in the documents that were recently turned over that would have reversed a verdict of guilty, or would have reversed a sentence of death for Timothy McVeigh. Justice, though, has been pretty mum today. They said -- Attorney General John Ashcroft said what he had to say yesterday after the stay was denied. Of course, we heard from the attorney general, he basically said just what I said, that there was no evidence of any innocence here, that the verdict would not have been overturned and so, therefore, it was a good day for Justice. Business as usual. Attorney general is headed home to Missouri. They are -- Justice is just -- was waiting. They either would have had to present a reply to the court today; that didn't happen. There was a judgment, and now we wait to see what happens at the Supreme Court level -- Judy.\",\n",
      "            \"And Kelli, in just a matter of a few second, the view inside the Justice Department that this McVeigh appeal was something serious that had serious merit, or just something that was a desperate last attempt?\",\n",

Well, after three months of closure, visitors are now welcomed back. CNN's Cyril Vanier joins us now. He visited the tower, he's in Paris, and of course, here to talk about his experience. And Cyril, it's hard to find a more recognizable landmark, and to enjoy it, you had to take the stairs. How did that go?\",\n",

And what I realized filming this report, Rosemary is I have lived in Paris most of my life, but as most Parisian, you've kind of take it for granted, you enjoyed the Eiffel Tower as part of the cityscape, but you will never go up unless you have a relative or a friend visiting from abroad. So, I really got a refresher course in the Eiffel Tower tourist experience. Take a look, Rosemary.\",\n",
      "            \"During the worst days of the coronavirus crisis, Paris' iron lady still played her part with a simple message to health care workers from a grateful nation. Thank you. The Eiffel Tower visited by almost 7 million tourists a year shut down three months, one week and four days ago. The longest closure since the Second World War. I haven't been back to the Eiffel Tower in many years, and my first impression is at the ground level right here is an underrated vantage point of the tower itself, just look up. This feels pretty special. The first level, a reminder that the Eiffel Tower experience is now covid compatible. Distancing, signage, face masks, and hand gel. The new normal. The tower keen to show it's even going a step further, regularly checking that surfaces are well and truly disinfected. For now, the lifts are closed, because of distancing rules, so if you want the view, well, you have to earn it. It's also more fun this way. 745 steps to the second level, that's a 15 minute climb for an estimated four to 5,000 visitors expected on day one.\",\n",

      "            \"Rosemary, there's a pretty big caveat to that Eiffel Tower at the moment, which is, remember I told you, the lifts aren't in use because of social distancing guidelines at the moment. Well, the problem is if you want to go from that second level up to the very top, which obviously, everyone wants to do. Well, you can't at the moment. Because there are no stairs, their only lifts. Two sets of lifts that ran up the last third of the Eiffel Tower. Those are not a news at the moment, so, the highest you can go right now is the second level, Rosemary.\",\n",

They're hoping they will be back to normal numbers by August. Frankly, Rosemary, I don't see how that's possible. Normal numbers in June for instance are 23,000 visitors a day. So, four times what they are going to get today. And the borders within Europe have reopened, so they are going to get the European travelers, but borders between Europe and the rest of the world? Not so sure. It depends where. They are not going to get for instance Americans in any, you know, in the next few weeks it seems.

The Iranians, they said, should stop the development of ballistic missiles which could be used as a delivery vehicle for a potential nuclear weapon immediately. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also weighing in, calling the tests evidence that the missile threat is real, not an imaginary one. Now the missile tests come as tensions, Heidi, have really been rising with the U.S. The State Department itself just announced new financial sanctions against Iranian officials and companies accusing them of helping develop nuclear weapons. The U.S. is also trying to squeeze Iran's economy. At the same time, Washington is pursuing a diplomatic path with Iran, along with the Europeans, basically offering Iran an incentives package in exchange for suspending uranium enrichment, which, as you know, is key in making a nuclear bomb. So the U.S. strategy is really both carrot and stick, but a real condemnation coming out today -- Heidi.\",\n",

And we know that Warren Jeffs has had some health problems over the past couple of years in jail. While he was awaiting trial, according to court documents, he refused to eat and drink for a significant amount of time, had to be taken to an infirmary, and later he tried to hang himself in jail. While he was on a suicide watch he was observed throwing himself into a wall and banging his head against the wall repeatedly. Now to give you a little bit of background, Jeffs is the so- called prophet of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- Day Saints. Now some of the 10,000 members practice polygamy using arranged marriages that sometimes involve underage girls. Jeffs first showed up on the national radar about two years ago when the FBI put him on it's 10 Most Wanted list. He was caught, tried and then convicted of using his religious influence to coerce his followers -- over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl to marry her 19-year-old cousin. And a lot of people will remember some of the images from April when the authorities came in and removed about 400 children from the FLDS ranch in Texas. It was a very emotional scene. And the Texas Supreme Court later ruled that the state did not have the authority to take the children and authorities were ordered to take them back to their families. Jeffs had been serving 10 years to life in prison. And we expect to get more word on his current condition in the next couple hours -- Heidi?\",\n",

      "            \"First up, Trump's dramatic new interview about a nuclear threat just days before he meets the leader of China at Mar-a-Lago. The president telling the \\\"Financial Times,\\\" \\\"well, if China is not going to solve North Korea, we will.\\\" It could make for a frosty meeting in sunny Florida later this week. And then there is the Russia probe. New revelations that Trump's former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, failed to initially disclose thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees. The president insisting it's just a distraction, tweeting, \\\"The real story turns out to be surveillance and leaking. Find the leakers.\\\" And let's not forget the Supreme Court. President Trump getting closer to a big win with Judge Neil Gorsuch. A third Democrat now says he will vote yes on the president's nominee. A committee vote comes tomorrow and then the full confirmation vote just five days away. We have a superstar team of reporters and analysts ready to cover every angle. I want to begin with CNN's Ryan Nobles outside the White House where the cloud of the Russia probe continues to hang over the Trump presidency, and Ryan, we heard from the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee today.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, that's right Ana. And Adam Schiff of course was here on Friday to review those materials that Devin Nunes -- that led Devin Nunes, the ranking member, the chair of the House Intel Committee to come and talk about what he viewed was at least something that substantiated the claims that President Trump had made several weeks ago about the Obama administration putting him under surveillance. And Schiff remains unmoved by what he saw here on Friday night, but he also seems committed to finding a way for this House Intel Committee to come to some court of conclusion in a bipartisan way. The same on the Senate side. We also heard from Mark Warner who is the ranking Democrat on the Senate side. Both men believe that they can still come to some sort of conclusion and do it with both Republicans and Democrats in agreement. Take a listen.\",\n",
      "            \"We don't want to do anything that will interfere in any case that the Justice Department may decide to bring. We also have to determine whether he really can add value to our investigation, whether we need him to learn information we can't learn from other sources. So it's very early I think even to be considering this.\",\n",
      "            \"We're not ready to consider that. We're not even publicly acknowledging that he's contacted us. If and when we would talk to General Flynn under whatever considerations, we'd want to make sure we knew all the right questions to ask but we're not anywhere close to making those -- drawing those conclusions yet.\",\n",
      "            \"So both men talking about whether Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisor, would be able to offer up immunity in exchange for his testimony. Both at this point not ready to go that far, Ana.\",\n",
      "            \"Stand by with me here and let's bring in Matt Rivers in Beijing. Matt, China's president will visit the U.S. and meet with President Trump for the first time this week. Today President Trump, in short said the U.S. will take on North Korea with or without China. How is Beijing reacting?\",\n",
      "            \"When Beijing wakes up here a little bit later on this morning in China, what they're going to look at and say is what they've said very consistently. The Chinese have been very consistent in their position that the only way to solve the ongoing crisis in the Korean Peninsula is through direct negotiation, is through the United States sitting down with the regime in Pyongyang, hopefully with China there at the table as well, and begin to hash out some sort of bargain, some sort of deal to get Pyongyang to halt its weapons program. That has been China's position for well over a decade now. Every time the Trump administration brings up that China should be doing more, that China should be using its economic leverage over Pyongyang to get them to stop their weapons program, China always counters with the exact same thing. So I think you can expect the Chinese to be very consistent here. And I also think going into this meeting though that this perhaps isn't going to be a huge surprise to the Chinese given what we've heard from the Trump administration talking tough on China pretty regularly. I don't think that this is going to come as a big surprise to the Chinese. It's certainly going to be something that they're going to take a look at ahead of this big meeting scheduled between President Xi and President Trump later this week in Florida.\",\n",
      "            \"All right, Matt Rivers and Ryan Nobles, thanks to both of you. I want to talk more about this with our panel, Washington bureau chief for the \\\"Chicago Sun Times,\\\" Lynn Sweet, Republican strategist and former RNC communications director Doug Heye and CNN contributor and former Missouri Secretary of State, Jason Kander, a Democrat. Lynn, I'll start with you. What do you make of the tough talk ahead of the president's meeting with China's leader?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, he's trying to set the stage and be the -- he's trying to make it clear to China that he wants to dictate terms of the meeting. He wants to do this, he wants to do that. This is not any kind of diplomatic niceties back and forth and you know, he's still new at diplomacy. It certainly doesn't surprise anyone that he's telegraphing his punch. Now whether or not he wants to really make good on the promise to go it alone on North Korea, that's a very serious subject and a very serious pledge so, we'll see what comes of all this bravado.\",\n",
      "            \"And Doug, your reaction to Trump's go-it-alone comment, on top of a tweet earlier this week in which he said this is going to be a difficult meeting with China's president. Is this smart politics? What kind of tone does it real set for the week's meeting?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I think it's an honest one. This will be a difficult meeting and if you look at what Nikki Haley, his ambassador to the U.N., former South Carolina governor, said on TV today, she also said that China needs to lead with North Korea because if they don't there is a real vacuum of power. We've got a lot of issues that we've got to deal with China, currency being one of them. But certainly is North Korea is at the forefront right now. Well I've certainly been critical of Donald Trump in the past. I think he's being pretty blunt and honest here about where things are going. It may not be the most diplomatic thing in the world, but it's pretty pressing and probably pretty accurate.\",\n",
      "            \"But let's remember too Trump tried to kind of strong-arm China previously with again more of a tough posture. Remember the One- China policy and the phone call with Taiwan. China seemed to walk away when that was all said and done in the winter, Doug.\",\n",
      "            \"And they may do that, you know. If you go back to say the Taiwan call, for instance, that was also a part of the time in the transition when the Trump organization was not organized at all and anybody could kind of free-wheeling make phone calls when they wanted to and get the president basically on a cell phone. Certainly that's been fixed now and that's why they're trying to set the stage now that they are in charge and they're moving things forward. We'll see if it works.\",\n",
      "            \"Do you see the Jason the words that we're hearing from Trump as provocative? Do you worry at all about the message he's sending to not only China but North Korea?\",\n",
      "            \"I generally worry about the message the president is sending, which is probably one of the biggest differences between me and the president. He doesn't seem to worry about it very often which is why we're always told that at times we're supposed to take him literally, and other times we're supposed to take him figuratively. So, what this all goes to is, you used the word bravado. That's exactly what it is. And whether it makes sense if any given situation, defaulting to bravado is not a very good way to approach diplomatic relations because it is not at all diplomatic, and at times it can put people in harm's way.\",\n",
      "            \"I want you all to listen to something Nikki Haley said, the U.N. ambassador. She was grilled about some different stances she and the president have had on Russia in terms of the rhetoric. Let's listen.\",\n",
      "            \"President Trump has said he respects Putin but you say you don't trust him. You've said the U.S. needs to take hacking seriously, President Trump has been dismissive of it. Which one of you should our allies and adversaries believe?\",\n",
      "            \"I think we're both saying the same thing, it's just being reported differently.\",\n",
      "            \"Lynn, is that the case? Have they been saying the same thing?\",\n",
      "            \"No, no. No they haven't, even from the earliest days of U.N. Ambassador Haley's tenure at the United Nations. She had a tougher speech on Russia in its dealings with the Ukraine than President Trump did. So Martha Raddatz is a foreign policy veteran and she had it right.\",\n",
      "            \"Well Doug, let's talk about what the president was doing today. It was his 14th time playing golf since he's taken office. He had a special guest with him today, Senator Rand Paul was alongside. And as you know Paul has not been a cheer leader, we could say, of Trump. Afterward he tweeted this, \\\"I had a great time today with President Trump and believe we are getting closer to an agreement on health care.\\\" So how ironic if Rand Paul saves President Trump from what some have said is the biggest policy disaster he has had to date?\",\n",
      "            \"No. Look, I think this is one of the smart things where that the Trump administration has done where the Obama administration fell flat and this isn't policy. This is just the politics of trying to get things done on Capitol Hill. President Obama obviously played a lot of golf but he tended to play either with his own White House aides or celebrities from Hollywood or athletes, and certainly I'd rather play golf with Larry David and Mick Mulvaney although Mick Mulvaney is a scratch golfer and really do it.\",\n",
      "            \"Trump has also been seen out there with some --\",\n",
      "            \"Absolutely.\",\n",
      "            \"-- of those celebrities as well.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, my point is by being out there and playing with members, you're able to establish relationships and that's one of the things even Democrats on Capitol Hill would tell you the Obama White House just didn't do. John Boehner was only invited one time and a John Boehner is a prodigious golfer -- only invited one time with President Obama. I think it's very smart of Trump to do this. I would encourage him to do it with a lot of Democrats, too.\",\n",
      "            \"As we pointed out Jason, Paul was one of the big critics of this health care bill that the Republicans have put out. Remember he calls it Obamacare lite, which was a phrase echoed from the Freedom Caucus as well. So, if Trump and Paul can come to some kind ever agreement on health care, what does that tell you?\",\n",
      "            \"It will mean that they come to an agreement on something that even less than 17 percent of the American people think is a good idea. That was the approval rating if I recall correctly of the Obamacare replacement bill that they came up with.\",\n",
      "            \"That's a fact.\",\n",
      "            \"So, if they're going to come up with something that Rand Paul and Donald Trump agree on, that means it's going to be closer to the right wing than it was to wherever it was before, which means that an even bigger amount of people will think it's a really bad idea and will be even less likely to pass, which is a good thing for the country because it would cost, I believe the last bill would have cost 14 million people to loose health care right away.\",\n",
      "            \"I'll let you respond Doug.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, look, obviously they're trying to sort this out. The hardest part of anything as we've seen for the past few years in Congress is getting to 218 votes in the House of Representative. I can tell you I worked a lot votes on the House where we had to have to pull the vote or we lost the vote on the floor. It's an embarrassing situation and you're certainly projecting to the Democrats and to the country at large that you're not in a position of strength. So the smart thing for Trump to do is try and get some kind of package that can pass the house that the Senate will at least look at. Whatever the popularity numbers are after the facts, that you can deal with after the facts. You've got to pass the bill first if you're going to do anything.\",\n",
      "            \"And Lynn, the president did address health care in this \\\"Financial Times\\\" interview that he had this afternoon and he actually referred to the Freedom Caucus as his friends which caught my eye. I thought that was an interesting comment after all these attacks that we've seen on twitter going after the Freedom Caucus. Is that how he treats his friends?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, yes and we have a few things out there. Clearly President Trump just wants to make a deal. That's what this is evolving into. If 30 Democrats came over to him tonight and said we'll thrown in with the Republicans and maybe we need this or that, maybe they would get them. Now, this isn't going to happen. You know, these health care policies are also rooted in deeply held beliefs by members of the Republican Party. So, you might think you have a deal with Rand Paul but what did you actually make a deal to that will help not loose other Republicans as you get to the mark of -- I think right now the number is 216 that they need to pass. So, what is the core belief that President Trump has that he is trying to get done here? It seems just -- it just seems to say the least in Congress that, you know, in one tweet or one statement you say you want to work the Democrats then these Freedom Caucus guys are no good, I'm going to run against them, you know, naming\",\n",

      "            \"Yes, hello, Heidi. That attack you referred to took place in the Sadr City neighborhood. That's a northern suburb of Baghdad, a very poor Shiite neighborhood where one U.S. soldier was killed, four were wounded, in addition to a civilian interpreter who was working with those soldiers. Now, that area, actually, has been very unstable for quite some time. But there haven't been a lot of attacks on U.S. forces there because that Shiite area has long been very hostile to the former regime of Saddam Hussein and most people there had actually welcomed U.S. troops initially. But as the situation in Baghdad becomes more difficult with electricity cuts, with water cuts, with many other services unavailable, people are becoming frustrated and the level of anger toward the U.S. presence is rising. Now, another development. According to a senior military official, investigators are, in his words, within hours of resolving the disappearance of two soldiers who went missing on Wednesday night in an area about 40 kilometers to the north of Baghdad. Now, U.S. forces have taken six people into custody in connection with that case. Yesterday there were fairly extensive air and ground searches for those two soldiers and the Humvee they were in. But at least those air and ground searches, we are told, did not come up with anything. Now, another development in Baghdad. There has been a series of fires set around the capital. Dave Rusk (ph), my cameraman and I, spent a long time running around the city basically going from one fire to another, as they were just going in various parts of the town. In several cases, they were warehouses, some of them old and no longer in use, in fact, in areas that had been subject to intensive looting. But I spoke with the head of the Baghdad civil defense, who told me that it's clear that many of these fires were set by arsons -- Heidi.\",\n",

      "            \"Well, actually, they're -- it doesn't appear that there's much looting going on because there's nothing left to loot. It does appear to be a case of out straight cut arson. And, in fact, the head of civil defense told me that some, several people had been brought in for questioning. It's not known who's behind it. But what we do know is that -- in fact, there's just a fire going on just up the street from here -- that this is something of a sudden development. You have had fires on a fairly regular basis, but none as sort of as common and as frequent as they are today -- Heidi.\",\n",

The billionaire Republican candidate already on the hot seat saying McCain is not a war hero. Now, in a \\\"USA Today\\\" op-ed, Trump blames McCain for covering up the V.A. hospital scandal and says the senator, quote, \\\"has made America less safe\\\" and, quote, \\\"sent our soldiers into wrong-headed foreign adventures\\\". Trump also tears into other Republican candidates who blasted him for criticizing McCain. He writes, \\\"A number of my competitors for the nomination have no business running for president.

I will be able to build them new hospitals. I will be able to build them care centers. I'll be able to help the veterans. John McCain has failed, because all you have to do is take a look which you report on all the time, take a look at the scandal at the Veterans Administration and the disastrous conditions under which our veterans have to live.

A U.S. law enforcement official familiar with the says family members are telling investigators that Abdulazeez suffered from bipolar disorder, he had been abusing painkillers, sleeping pills, marijuana and other so-called party drugs. The official says Abdulazeez had sought treatment from the psychiatrist, the family sent him away to Jordan last year to get him away from friends they believe were bad influences. The official also saying the family was aware of the high power weapons Abdulazeez owned, that he used most of his money to buy weapons and often went target shooting.

People in the crowd waving flags, offering signs of support and condolence to the families of those affective. Randall Smith's mother, Paula, actually visited the memorial. She was visibly emotional and she was overcome with grief when she saw a picture of her son behind me here at the memorial. I've got a chance to speak with her. She said she was overwhelmed by the amount of support she's in the community, but she choked up after I asked how her family was holding up. We're also hearing from the family of the shooter for the first time, Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez's family, putting out a statement, offering condolences and sympathies for those affected by the shooting, and writing, quote, \\\"There are no words to describe our shock, horror and grief. The person who committed this horrible crime was not the son we knew and loved for many years. Our son suffered from depression. It grieves us beyond belief to know that his pain found an expression in this heinous act of violence.\\\" That tidbit about depression bring up the question of whether or not this was more than a just a jihadist mentality that led to the shooting but also potentially a sign of mental illness on behalf of the shooter -- Christine.\",\n",

On Sunday, the administration officially submitted the deal to Congress, starting what looks to be 60 days of no-holds barred debate. Meanwhile, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter arrived in Israel earlier this morning.

At the beginning of their meetings, the two discussed their country's mutual friendship, a friendship which by all accounts has been put to the test in recent days. Israel is, of course, one of the Iran nuclear deal's harshest and most vocal critics, the deal that, of course, the United States helped to broker. Now, the difference is that the secretary -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter addressed the plane flight from Tel Aviv, saying even friends can disagree. Take a listen.\",\n",

The purpose of my trip is to work on all the things that we do together to guarantee the security of American interests in the region and very importantly, one of those is the security of Israel. Obviously, we believe that the nuclear deal promotes the security in the region, the American strategy and also the defense of Israel. But as I said, friends can disagree.\",\n",

On Saturday, Iran's supreme leader saying the policies towards the United States would not change as a result of the nuclear agreement. On Sunday, in his weekly cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu addressing those remarks, saying, quote, \\\"as long as the Iranian leadership continues for its calls of death to America and death to Israel, there is no reason to make compromises. Now, Secretary Carter for his part saying that this nuclear agreement does not take a U.S. military option off the table and U.S. officials saying that part of the reasons for this trip is to take a look, a very critical look at what more can be done to counter Iran's destabilizing, what they term to be Iran's destabilizing influence in the region -- Christine.\",\n",

Following breaking news: four Italians kidnapped in Libya. A crisis team now activated to try to free the construction company workers. No word who might have taken them. Italy closed its embassy in Libya back in February and urged all of its citizens to leave the country as Libya sank into chaos and violence. Tens of thousands of migrants, many coming from Libya, have entered Italy by sea in recent months. Time for an early start on your money. European markets are higher.

We couldn't get an interview or statement from Dunn. She told \\\"The Washington Post\\\" she was misquoted and said she told the author, Suskind, that the White House was not a hostile work environment.

And the women went to Valerie Jarrett, who is one of the president's oldest friends and one of his closest advisers in the White House, and she took this to the president, and went to the president. And he convened a dinner and met with these senior women and heard them out. And by all accounts, things got much better after the president heard them out, and he took steps to improve things. I will say that I just spoke to a former White House staffer who has now left the building, a woman who says that to the extent that there were problems, it was, in her view, because the president wasn't aware of what his staff was doing, and once he was aware, they got better. But I will also say that it's known among Democratic women around Washington that there is a concern about a boys club environment in this White House.\",\n",

      "            \"Absolutely. And I think Brian Todd pointed it out well, two female deputy chiefs of staff and appointed two women to the Supreme Court. But it's also a great opportunity for us to also acknowledge that there is a difference between giving women a lofty title and actual influence, and not just in this White House, but in politics in general. And I cannot tell you how many dinners I have attended with women political operatives over the years from both parties who say it is so challenging for them because they are maybe one or two female voices on an entire team, and it is so hard for their voices to be heard because they are so outnumbered by the men. And this is an ongoing issue in politics that I think is worth our talking about.\",\n",

They waited until eight days before the first execution was scheduled to disclose the fact that they had these affidavits of recantation, as they're pleased to call them. What did we learn from that? We learned from that, in my opinion, that the affidavits of recantation were of more value to the attorneys as a device for delay than they were valuable to the attorneys as a device for substantive argument. It has been a game of delay throughout. The longer the delay, the more time they have to create, not doubt, not honest doubt, not real doubt, but the appearance of doubt.\",\n",

The president wants $3 in tax increases for every $1 in spending cuts. That's according to analysis done by \\\"The Washington Times.\\\" His plan will go nowhere in Congress. Besides the $1.5 trillion in new taxes, here are the president's ideas of spending cuts. Find waste in Medicare. Where have we heard that before? Count savings from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. That was going to happen anyway. Count lower interest costs on the national debt. Where are the cuts? No entitlement reform in this plan, no orders to cut the federal work force, to cut federal budgets by a significant amount or to close overseas military bases, no means test for Social Security, no raising of the retirement age, nothing. Meanwhile, as we wait for the so-called super committee in Congress to come up with their plan, the deficit situation is a ticking time bomb. Here's the scary truth. Even if the super committee comes up with $1.5 trillion in deficit cuts over the next decade, it is a minuscule drop in the bucket. Our country is more than $14 trillion in debt right now. And we're adding to that debt at the staggering rate of a trillion dollars plus every year. So even if the government cuts $3 trillion or $4 trillion over 10 years, we will still have a national debt of $21 trillion in 10 years, $7 trillion more than we have right now. The federal government knows all this full well and simply refuses to be realistic about how dangerous our predicament is. So here is the question. Is anyone besides Ron Paul serious about our deepening national financial crisis?

And if he had concerns and he felt that other people might have had concerns to have asked those questions then and to allay people's fears. And coming from a prominent politician, that would have put things to bed. I think that -- you know, Paolo has had this opportunity. He's been offered this job. He's taken the job. He's totally focused on football. And for people then to sort of turn to politics, it's sad, to be honest. He's been in England as manager of Swindon for two years.

His agent is Jewish. You know, these are things that people don't take into account. He comes from the working class background. Dad was a bricky. He lost both his parents while he was with us. Family comes very, very high on his agenda. So people at Sunderland who are concerned: family, club, family issues. The fans at Swindon were concerned.

That story in just a moment. First want to get to the headlines at this hour. A deadly weekend for U.S. forces in Iraq. One soldier was killed early today by a roadside bomb in Baghdad. Three others were killed several hours earlier by a similar bomb here in the capital. And then an explosion in Tikrit killed two soldiers on Saturday. Spaniards are voting at this hour, knowing that al Qaeda has taken responsibility for Thursday's blood bath in Madrid. Authorities have not authenticated a videotape that claims to be from an al Qaeda operative. Five people are now in custody in connection with the commuter train bombings that killed 200 people. Russians are also voting right now. President Vladimir Putin is expected to win another four year term if enough people cast ballots for the election to be valid. At least 55 million Russians must vote. Against this backdrop, the Kremlin today warned the Republic of Georgia against using force in the autonomous region of Adzharia after Georgia's president was prevented from entering the region. Pope John Paul II today becomes the longest serving pope in a century. He surpasses Leo XIII, who was pope from 1878 to 1903. John Paul is still six years shy of the 31 years served by Pius the IX, in the 19th century. Catholics regard Jesus' disciple Peter as the first pope, a position he held for a record 34 years. To debate or not to debate? That is the question looming over this year's presidential race. John Kerry is challenging President Bush to a monthly series of debates from here to election day. The senator, who's taking center stage at a town hall meeting in Pennsylvania today, made the invitation in Quincy, Illinois yesterday, site of the historic debates between Abraham Lincoln and Steven Douglas.\",\n",

Neil Armstrong, the first person to walk on the moon says Americans should support President Bush's plan for new missions to the moon. And he told \\\"The Houston Chronicle\\\" the country can afford it. Bush's plan calls for a return to the moon by the year 2020.

That comes your way at 12:00 p.m. Eastern. In Washington, Missouri Congressman Dick Gephardt was among the VIPs last night at a gay and lesbian awards ceremony. Gephardt said he and his wife were proud to attend as a show of support for their daughter Chrissy and her partner. The former presidential candidate lashed out at President Bush's support for a constitutional amendment to prohibit same sex marriage. If new polls are any indication, it's going to remain an uphill battle for anyone trying to legalize gay and lesbian marriages, though. According to a CNN/\\\"USA TODAY\\\"/Gallup survey taken this past week, 61 percent of those interviewed say gay marriages should not be recognized as valid. When asked if they would favor a constitutional amendment that would define marriage as only between a man and a woman, 50 percent said yes. 45 percent are against an amendment banning gay marriages. People are more open to the idea of civil unions, as long as they're not called marriage. When asked if they favor civil unions, giving gays some of the legal rights of traditional marriages, 54 percent said yes; 42 percent opposed. The issue of gay marriages is one of the year's hottest topics, as you know. In Atlanta, some people say gay couples do not enjoy the same rights and privileges as married couples, even on the golf course.\",\n",

Bush wanted a free- flowing debate around a table with a moderator; he got it. Voters wanted a town hall where they could ask the questions; they got it. Everybody happy? Not quite.

They defeated Forbes by just 39 votes in the Democratic primary. No, Republicans could not vote in the New York Democratic primary, but they spent an estimated $100,000 on mailings and on get-out-the vote phone calls to get anti-Forbes Democrats to vote. It was very sneaky, but it worked. The Democrats ended up nominating an untested, unknown, 71-year- old grandmother.

Are they being recruited by the Al- Shabaab terror group to attack Americans? The FBI is all over it, investigating the possibility, a story every American needs to see.

Your national conversation on the air and on the Web, where America tunes in as we cut to the change.\",\n",
      "            \"All right, let's cut to the change, first of all, by telling you what the president's been doing. He's been meeting with CEOs of key companies in the United States, trying to convince them of the urgency of getting the stimulus package approved. Speaking of CEOs, many of them are all over the world. Davos, Switzerland, is where Richard Quest is going to be joining us from in just a little bit. He's going to be telling us how the CEOs are responding to Mr. Obama's plan there. But, first, let's go to Patricia Murphy, CitizenJanePolitics.com . It looks like what the president's trying to do is kind of appease both sides here, the Democrats and the Republicans. The Democrats are saying, look, too many tax cuts. The GOP, the Republicans, are saying there's too much pork in this package. Was there any ground gained by either side today?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, it looks like right now the Republicans are digging in their heels. It looks like he may get about five to 15 members of the Republican Caucus to vote for this, which is not the resounding bipartisan success he wanted. We're also starting to hear that some Democrats have started to complain that this bill doesn't have either enough infrastructure spending, -- we're hearing that from some liberals -- or it has too much spending. We're hearing that from the Blue Dog Democrats. Those are those really conservative Democrats, Southern Democrats, many of whom delivered for Obama in their home states, Virginia, North Carolina, Louisiana. They are really begging off of this package. So, he's trying to thread a very, very thin needle here.\",\n",
      "            \"All right, stay with us here, folks, because I understand we're going to be going to John Boehner here any moment now. And John Boehner, like Nancy Pelosi about 45 minutes ago, is going to be explaining from his perspective what's wrong with the stimulus package, or maybe what's right with it. We have been hearing in the past from John Boehner that there's too much pork in this thing. Were they any more specific, Murph, today with what they mean by too much pork?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, it's becoming very clear that pork is just in the eye of the beholder. Democrats defend this spending very, very strongly. They say that if you look at some of the complaints from the Republicans, the USDA headquarter building in Washington, for example, the Republicans have raised that as wasteful spending. The Democrats say those are going to be jobs for contractors and construction workers. You can go through this bill. I actually encourage people to read it. It's 647 pages, but you can get through it. Project after project after project, tons and tons of spending, Democrats defend it. Republicans attack it. And Obama has to walk the middle and try and get this passed. It will pass. But he wants a strong, strong support. And that's going to be the tough part today.\",\n",
      "            \"All right. We have got some tape coming in now. This is the president today when he was meeting with some of those CEOs. He also met with senators, both Republicans and Democrats. By the way, one of the biggest things that's happening right now in the entire world is in Davos, Switzerland. That is where probably one of the most important economic summits in decades is taking place. Richard Quest is there. He's going to be joining us in just a little bit. In the meantime, I get a feeling that part of the reason this thing, Murph, is so important is because the president may not get a redo on this thing. I mean, this is his chance to show the American people, to show both Republicans and Democrats and to show the business community that we have got to get this done. Whether he's right or wrong, this is his time, his moment, as he says.\",\n",
      "            \"That's exactly right. It's his moment. It's also the moment for the economy. It's very unclear how much longer the economy can hold on without an infusion of spending and tax cuts. But, again, there's just debate, how do you do it? When do you do it? I will say that Obama is picking up some support, but we heard from some of those business leaders today it's not a resounding guarantee. And when you hear from members of Congress, because this looks like the biggest, fastest train leaving the station, they are larding it up with some of their pet projects.\",\n",
      "            \"Murph, I'm going to stop you for just a minute. I understand part of the debate is taking place right now. Let's do this. Let's dip into that real quick, see if they're talking about the stimulus plan. Let's do that, Dan.\",\n",

      "            \"They're talking about this. Hey, Murph, before we let you go, look, here's what I have been reading in the last couple of days in places like \\\"The Washington Post\\\" and \\\"The Wall Street Journal,\\\" the concern that the problem is so big, and that so much money has to be thrown at this, our money, as Americans, that, by the time we're all done, we're going to be nationalizing a lot of the things that we have always tried to keep as a part of free trade in our government. How big a concern is that? And what are you hearing from the administration about that concern?\",\n",
      "            \"It's a very big concern. There is a very fine line that they're trying to walk between infusing banks in particular -- they need this capital -- infusing them with money. But at what point have you basically bought those banks outright? There are some reports that we have actually spent more on some of these banks trying to rescue them than they're even worth. So, does the U.S. government own them in effect? That really changes the nature of our entire financial system. That's not a debate that we fully had. A lot of members of Congress are saying we're throwing money at the system, but we need to step back and figure out what we're really doing long term that's going to either be good or bad for our financial system.\",\n",
      "            \"I'm going to let you go. Here's John Boehner talking about the stimulus package.\",\n",
      "            \"We're continuing to try to work with President Obama to get an economic rescue package signed into law as quickly as possible, but one that will work. And when I say work, one that will help create jobs in America and help preserve jobs in America. The bill that's on the floor of the House as we speak we don't think will work and, frankly, are disappointed in the product that we see, a lot of wasteful spending that won't create jobs and won't help preserve jobs in America. We think there's a better way. Our fast-acting tax relief that we'll be offering here soon really will reduce tax rates on the American people, reduce taxes on small businesses, and get our economy moving, and really will create jobs and preserve jobs in America. We've just done an analysis of our proposal and found that our proposal will create 6. 2 million new jobs in America. That's twice as many as the -- the bill that's on the floor now, at about half the price of the bill that's on the floor now. Dave Camp and the staff of the Ways and Means Committee worked all night to develop this. We really do think this is a better way, and now we've got the proof. And the proof isn't just from numbers that we've crunched. This comes from a model by the president's own nominee to head the Council of Economic Advisers and Vice President Biden's chief economic expert. And so we do have a plan and good ideas that will help preserve jobs in America and help create new jobs. And to talk more about that, Eric Cantor.\",\n",
      "            \"Thank you, Leader. Without a question, the House Republicans are still working very hard to try and get this stimulus bill right. Our message to the president, our message to the speaker has been, will be the economy needs a stimulus. Often we're hearing discussions about many nice, laudable programs in the House Democrat bill, but we need to distinguish between what is relief, what is a safety net, and what is stimulus. And if we are really committed to reviving this economy, we've got to have a stimulus bill that preserves the jobs we have and that creates new ones. And as Leader Boehner said and as Ranking Member Camp will talk about, our plan has now -- it has been substantiated that it creates twice as many jobs as what the Democrats' plan will do. Again, a stimulus bill should do just that. Earlier today, I was told that Alice Rivlin, a former economic expert in the Clinton administration, even said that the Democrat plan has a lot of great long-term investment programs but is short on short-term stimulus, is short on the ability to create jobs. The plan that the Republican -- House Republican working group put together is very focused on creating jobs by providing tax relief to families and small businesses, entrepreneurs, and the self- employed, because, after all, that's where 70 percent of the jobs in this country are created.\",\n",

What they're saying is, whatever we pass has to be something that stimulates the economy and not a hockey ring in Poughkeepsie or anything of that ilk. Now, what's interesting about this, and sometimes the viewers key in on this stuff before anybody else does, it has to be up to Barack Obama, the president, to say that's what we're going to do. We're going to prioritize stimulating the economy. Look at this question that comes in from Beth. She's watching our newscast right now. And she asks a very relevant question. This is on our Twitter board, guys. \\\"How is Obama going to be able to cut the pork without a line-item veto?\\\" Can he do it?\",\n",

He can ask members of Congress not to put pork in there. And he can shame them into not putting pork in there. He says he's going to have all of these projects on a Web site, so that people can see where the money's being spent. And he did get in touch with house Democrats and ask them to take out the funding for the Mall and the funding for contraceptives. But that took a lot of political capital for him to just get in there and do something very small. That was symbolically very important. But he doesn't have a lot of tools at his disposal.\",\n",
      "            \"This one is coming in from my MySpace as we talk about the economy with what we're hearing now from both Democrats, the Republicans, and the president. \\\"Bush tried a stimulus package. It didn't work. I want change, not more of the same. Everyone praises Obama's intelligence, but he's just rushing a stimulus plan through Congress which no one is sure will work, just like Bush. Where is the change?\\\" What do you make of that comment, Murph?\",\n",
      "            \"I think that's the exact problem that members of Congress are wrestling with right now. They will vote for this if they thinks it is going to work. Nobody knows if it's going to work. Economists are making recommendations from all sides. They're getting an earful from their constituents. Everybody wants the economy to get out of this crisis, but they just don't know what to do. We do know, however, there are more problems down the road. We understand from the Department of Treasury there are waves of additional problems coming forward. They may have to throw more money at the banks. They may have to do more spending. So, Obama is just trying to get his coalition together to at least get this single step passed. They don't know if it's going to work. They know they may have to come back to Congress in a couple of weeks or a couple of months. So, the viewers have keyed into that, really.\",\n",

      "            \"Good evening, everyone, welcome to the program. I'm Christiane Amanpour. President Barack Obama's stealth mission to Afghanistan on Tuesday was clearly meant to send a message that the United States is now seeing the beginning of the end of America's longest war. But within a few hours of his departure, as if to mock that very claim, Taliban suicide bombers dressed in burqas attacked a guarded compound that houses international contractors, and seven people were killed. It marked one year since Osama bin Laden was killed. That trip and President Obama and the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, signed an agreement to keep some kind of U.S. presence in Afghanistan until 2024. But while many crucial details of the so-called long-term partnership agreement are yet to be worked out, the president said he's already pulling out the surge troops that he sent in. And so in my brief tonight, this question: are Americans rushing for the exits in Afghanistan and does that put what America and the rest of the international forces have fought for there at risk? The president himself has dramatically reduced the goals of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.\",\n",
      "            \"We'll work with the Afghans to determine what support they need to accomplish two narrow security missions beyond 2014, counterterrorism and continued training. But we will not build permanent bases in this country, nor will we be patrolling in cities and mountains. That will be the job of the Afghan people.\",\n",
      "            \"As I said, all the surge forces are meant to be out by the end of the summer. The surge itself was supposed to either beat the Taliban on the battlefield or force them to the negotiating table. Neither has happened. And so will the U.S. and the international forces leave behind a success or an Afghanistan that, as one expert asked, is just good enough? To get answers to these questions, I turned to America's ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan Crocker. He accompanied the president throughout his trip yesterday and on the helicopter ride, where he went to meet President Karzai. I spoke with the ambassador a short time ago.\",\n",
      "            \"Ambassador Ryan Crocker, thank you so much for joining me from Kabul.\",\n",
      "            \"Delighted to be with you, Christiane.\",\n",
      "            \"Ambassador, let me first ask you. The president comes. The president goes. Another suicide bombing right in the heart of Kabul outside an aid agency, a big truck bomb. How dangerous was it for the president and how secure is the capital?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, clearly it was secure enough for the president to make the trip. We looked at all aspects of that. Everybody was comfortable. It went precisely according to schedule. Today's suicide attack was tragic. We regret the loss of innocent Afghan lives. But overall, Christiane, Kabul is a pretty normal, pretty secure city. We have these unfortunate, isolated terrorist attacks, but they don't really affect the rhythm of the city.\",\n",
      "            \"Except there was a very big one a couple of weeks ago. I want to ask you, do you believe that this one was timed for the president's visit?\",\n",
      "            \"We don't have the full facts yet, Christiane. It just happened some hours ago. I don't think it was. It took place in an area that was nowhere near where the president was. I think it was a preplanned attack that simply went off at the time it did, but had nothing to do with his visit.\",\n",
      "            \"We're hearing that there was a potential security breach some four hours before he landed. What can you tell us about whether there was a breach, and what would that have done? Was there any thought that the president might have to turn around in mid-flight?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, we were aware of the press reports. The leak, such as it was, was incorrect, and our collective judgment was that it did not propose -- pose a sufficient threat to the president that he should in any way change or curtail his planned trip, and it went off exactly as we'd planned it.\",\n",
      "            \"Were there any nervous moments there for you, though, when you heard that leak?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, look, Christiane. This is Afghanistan. It's a country that faces insurgent attacks that, in most cases, come from outside its own territory. There is always a risk. You can't eliminate the risk. You can manage it, and we all felt that we could manage this one and we did. It was a very successful visit.\",\n",
      "            \"What is the status of negotiations with the Taliban? Is there anything happening that gives you hope that there can be a negotiated end to this right now?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, first, Christiane, I learned this in Iraq. You really cannot kill your way out of an insurgency. Eventually there does have to be a political settlement. The Afghans are committed to this, but they're committed to it on very specific terms that, in order to reconcile and be part of the new Afghanistan, the Taliban have to break all ties with Al- Qaeda. They have to completely renounce violence and they have to accept the Afghan constitution, including its protections for women and minorities. And it is an Afghan-led process. Let me emphasize that.\",\n",
      "            \"Except for President Karzai told me that there's no negotiations right now of any meaningful sort with the Taliban.\",\n",
      "            \"There are contacts between Afghan government representatives and different factions of the insurgency. I can't tell you that they have been conclusive, but there are contacts.\",\n",
      "            \"Are there any times that you lie awake at night and you worry that all this effort, 10 years, America's longest war, may be at risk in a sort of rush for the exits?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, Christiane, given the pace of my days, absolutely nothing whatsoever keeps me awake at night, I can assure you, the few hours I get. I was here after the fall of the Taliban. I reopened our embassy at the beginning of 2002, have always had an interest in Afghanistan for its own sake and for the sake of American security. That's why I came out of retirement to return here as ambassador. I think the one thing that can really defeat us here is ourselves. If we decide we're tired, we don't want to do this anymore, that we're just going to pull the troops and we're going to go home before the Afghans are fully capable of assuring their own security, then we can lose this.\",\n",
      "            \"The president in his speech to the American people last night said that there must be a way to ensure that there are no safe havens for any terrorism into Afghanistan in Pakistan. What do you think is going to make sure that that happens, because right now it's still continuing. There's still cross-border attacks, attacks planned from there, and at the same time a practically broken relationship between the U.S. and Pakistan.\",\n",
      "            \"Christiane, I am hopeful that the enduring strategic partnership agreement we've just signed with Afghanistan is also going to be reassuring to the Pakistanis. I was ambassador there five years ago. I know how traumatized the Pakistanis were by our abrupt withdrawal after the Soviet defeat in 1989. They felt they were victimized by that. I think they've hedged their bets because they think we'll pull out again. Disagreement with Afghanistan is an indication to them, as well as to the Afghans and to the Americans, that we're not going to make the same mistake twice. We're going to be around.\",\n",
      "            \"But do you think they can and will turn off that tap?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I think they have to. They are suffering as much from terrorism in the tribal areas as we and the Afghans are. They've lost thousands of Pakistani troopers to the same terrorists who come across and attack Afghans and international forces. So, the president has this exactly right. The Pakistanis are going to have to find some way to subdue those safe havens, for their sake as well as for that of Afghanistan and the international presence here.\",\n",
      "            \"President Hamid Karzai told me a couple of weeks ago that after 2014, any time, Afghanistan would not be used to allow drones to be launched to conduct counterterrorism against militants in Pakistan. How much does that hamper the ability to go after those militants?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, there's nothing in the agreement, we concluded, that restricts the inherent right of self-defense of either party. 2014 is a long way off, and before we get to 2014, of course, we will be negotiating a bilateral security agreement with Afghanistan that is going to determine, you know, the presence, status and activities of our forces, so these are all questions really for the far future. My definition, frankly, the far future in Afghanistan is about a week from Friday.\",\n",
      "            \"I can hear what you're trying to say, but does it worry you that the president of Afghanistan is on the record -- so is his foreign minister -- as saying that they will not allow their territory to be used for what has become America's most powerful and main counterterrorism tool? Those are the drone strikes.\",\n",
      "            \"At this point, I feel that we are conducting business as usual, including the necessary defense of Afghan civilians, our own forces and Afghan forces, and I do not see any hindrance or restrictions put on them. The future? We'll see.\",\n",
      "            \"Ambassador Crocker, thank you very much for joining me from Kabul.\",\n",
      "            \"Thank you, Christiane. It was a pleasure.\",\n",
      "            \"So talking about President Obama's policy in Afghanistan, we also want to know what his opponent's foreign policy is there, now that he's running for president, Governor Mitt Romney is running against President Obama, and his chief adviser on foreign affairs will join me when we come back.\"\n",

      "            \"Well, it's a bit of both. It's the world that I live in, and I never - well, although I grew up in a black neighborhood, I went to predominantly white schools. And so - just as very long ago in the \\u201880s, Trey Ellis coined the phrase cultural mulatto. That's something that I feel that all of us are influenced by.

Because, again, having a daughter, having a 10-year-old, I have to be available to her if she comes, you know, knocking on the door of my office.

      "            \"Two American women will make history at Ft. Benning, Georgia. They're the first female students to graduate one of the U.S. military's most elite schools, the U.S. Army Ranger School. It's an intensive training program. The combat course so grueling only one-third of those who start it actually finish. Here's just a few examples of what's expected, 49 pushups, 59 sit-ups, a five-mile money from 40 minutes, swim and land navigation tests, 12- mile foot marches in three hours, obstacle courses, military mountaineering, parachute jumps, 27 days of mock combat patrols. It's all designed to teach those young soldiers how to overcome fatigue, hunger, and stress. I'm joined now by CNN's Pentagon correspondent, Barbara Starr; and Dan Lamothe, the national security reporter for the \\\"Washington Post.\\\" Barbara, first of all, give us a little significance, the historic significance of this accomplishment.\",\n",
      "            \"It is a moment of history for women in the military, Wolf. You know, women for the last many years have really many of them been pressing to try to get combat jobs opened up to them in this volunteer force. They want to serve in those jobs. This is a big step down the road to being able to do that. Not fully, but this is a step in the eyes of many military women to be able to prove that they can cut it, that they can do it. Now, in this Ranger class that started in April, a number of women did drop out but a lot of times, a as you pointed out, the men drop out as one of the most grueling courses that the military has. But still, a lot of decisions by the Pentagon about whether the actual jobs in the field in combat will, in fact, be open to women.\",\n",
      "            \"Dan, you watched this class since April and you've done excellent reporting on it. The first women soldiers were allowed into the Ranger school. You were there and got a rare look inside the program. Give us your analysis. Tell us what you saw.\",\n",
      "            \"Sure. I've been in a couple of different locations with them at this point. Ft. Benning earlier this year, they did pre Ranger training. They had an assessment course that they were required to pass before they jumped into the actual training. And then from there they move on to mountaineering in northern Georgia and more recently, in the last week or so, they've graduated from the Florida phase down at Eglin Air Force Base.\",\n",
      "            \"What happens to these women now, Dan?\",\n",
      "            \"At this point -- the next couple of days, really, this is time for celebration behind the scenes and get decent meals. Men and women alike, you don't sleep much and you don't each much during Ranger school and it's very well known for that. I remember in both phases, there are times when they are receiving instruction and that sort and you actually watch people fall asleep while standing up. They are that exhausted.\",\n",
      "            \"I'm sure they are. Barbara, I asked this question because the two women soldiers will be allowed to wear the prestigious tab on their uniforms but I'm told they won't be allowed to, for example, to try out for the elite regiment. Why is that?\",\n",
      "            \"Exactly right. This is the first step to be able to qualify. By the end of the year, this is what is critical. Defense secretary ash Carter has to make combat jobs and in other words they will have qualifications and can they go out into the field in Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa, wherever the Rangers may be set on the very elite missions which often are in very hot war zones, essentially kicking down the door, conducting very hot combat operations. A lot of these decisions and the services making recommendations to the Pentagon about what combat jobs they think can and should be open to women and, of course, let me take the opportunity to say that many military women will tell you they are already in combat. Since 9/11, some 88 women have been killed in action. Nearly 1,000 wounded -- Wolf?\",\n",
      "            \"That's a good point. Dan, what was the reaction of the men to having these women participate?\",\n",
      "            \"I think it's a really mixed bag. And you see that every time the story is published on it as well. There are those who question whether or not the standards were changed as a result of the women going through and the decision to have media on and not only talk to senior officials but one-on-one conversations with instructors and other soldiers involved in the process, they wanted to underscore the point that nothing has changed and these women had to go through the exact same curriculum and difficulties.\",\n",

It was a hurricane. And it is likely going to become one again tomorrow. That is the latest. Powerful straight line winds and driving rain all headed right now for the Jersey Shore, New York City, and parts of Connecticut. Our meteorologist Jennifer Gray is in Atlantic City. You are in a county where they have now Jennifer declared a state of emergency. You have got 40 million people under severe weather watches and warnings there. So, it is died down a bit but then will turn into a hurricane again tomorrow? Is that the latest?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. It you should regain hurricane strength winds by tomorrow afternoon. That is the latest, Poppy. And we are already feeling significant winds. Not tropical storm force, but definitely gusty here. And the storm is about 175 miles southeast of ocean city Maryland. We are going to see it continue to grow as we go through the next 24 hours. The biggest takeaway with this storm is, it is going to slow down. Look at the track. It could have those hurricane force winds by tomorrow afternoon and stay that way until Tuesday. So we could see a period of about 72 hours, even more, where this storm is going to have the hurricane strength wind. And it is going to sit just to the southeast of us, right off the coast of Maryland and Delaware until Tuesday. That's going to bring all of these winds out of the east on shore, pushing all of that water in. And that's why storm surge is the biggest concern. Also, the wind field is very, very large. The tropical storm force winds extend about 200 miles from the center. And so even though the storm is going to stay offshore we are going to get those winds on-shore. Look out here. You can see the rough conditions. The beaches are closed. This would normally be packed on Labor Day weekend. But you can see, no one allowed in the water. Couple of people trying to still get out here. You notice everyone wearing their jackets though. Temperatures are in the low 70s and with the wind, it is a bit cool out here to be out there on the beach. A lot of people, though, Poppy still in town. They say they are going to ride it out. A lot of people at the boardwalk right now. They are just doing to stay in the casinos, the restaurants. But keep in mind, storm surge is going to be huge problem, two to four feet possibly here along the Jersey Shore -- Poppy.\",\n",

      "            \"Yes, it's off to a great start, really. We had a rush about two hours ago But now we're seeing a lull. But you can see some of the travelers making their way through. Most of the people I've spoken this morning are really taking things in stride, but when you look at PDX at large, the administrators here are expecting to see one of the busiest travel seasons ever. In fact, when you add in the Christmas holiday, they're expecting to see numbers that will be the highest in its history. And we're talking about some two million travelers expected to pass through here within the next several weeks, dealing with both holiday weekends. And on average, on a daily basis you're talking about 48,000 passengers. So it's definitely a large number of travelers passing through here. But you can see they are going through smoothly. One thing we can tell you about, TSA -- they have really ramped up the efforts here as well at the security checkpoints. We saw four separate lines allowing people up to that checkpoint. So they're trying to shuttle people through. We've seen some really big backups in the past year over the years, but things are off to a great start, Daryn.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. Well, hopefully things will continue to go smoothly there in Portland -- a beautiful place to get to and spend the holidays. Mark Glyzewski from our affiliate KPTV, thank you. Now, right across the street, downtown Atlanta, the Georgia Aquarium. Fish not on the menu to eat but certainly on the menu to check out. Chad Myers has that wonderful assignment. Hey, Chad.\",\n",
      "            \"Daryn, good morning. It is a really great assignment. And the best part is actually watching the kids. The kids just enjoy this so much. We're standing in front of the big aquarium, the big exhibit. There are five other exhibits -- the cold (ph) exhibit, the piranha exhibit and so on. But this is the big tank. This is the whale shark tank that you will hear so much about, making this the largest aquarium in the world -- 6.1 million gallons in this tank here. It's almost like a 126-foot high definition TV set, because you don't even realize that it's real. And the kids are up there right along the glass. And there's a big grouper coming to this guy right here. And there are more than 3,000 fish in this tank all by itself. We'll keep talking here because eventually the whale sharks will come by. The whale sharks are Ralph and Norton from \\\"The Honeymooners\\\" -- you recognize those names. But the big sharks -- actually they're fish. But the whale sharks themselves, that's the big draw. When the whale shark will swim by, all the kids light up and this place gets really loud. The reason why he's not here now, Daryn, is because this place is a football field long and a half football field wide. It is big enough to put 217 buses stacked three deep all the way through this. So there is plenty of room for all the fish here to live in harmony. And it's funny, they don't eat each other. But I guess they're very well fed.\",\n",
      "            \"Hey, Chad, let me just jump in here, because while we're waiting to see the whale sharks live we're looking at tape of them so we know exactly what we're looking for.\",\n",
      "            \"It's hard to know what we're looking for. And that's one of the things that -- you know, it's hard to criticize the aquarium on its first or second day open, but there's not a lot of information on -- not a lot of signage, if you will.\",\n",
      "            \"About what you're looking at?\",\n",
      "            \"That's actually on purpose. They don't -- if you want to have this an educational experience, you can go pick up things at the information desk and bring it with you. They didn't want big signs to get in the way of seeing the fish. This is supposed to be an experience -- oh, here comes a scuba diver, too. This is supposed to be an experience that you just enjoy yourself. You don't necessarily have to learn something. Although I like to learn something everywhere I go, so I did pick up the information packet and it was quite great. Take a look to the left. Can you get all the way to the left almost to the pole, if you keep -- my camera man is going to keep pulling to the left. The scuba diver here right before you -- I don't even know if you can get the angle or not -- but they are in there, they're cleaning the place. There are over 5,000 volunteers on a daily basis, Daryn, that come through here, keep the place clean, scuba divers.\",\n",

      "            \"Yes, let's pan to the right here just a little bit. We're going to go all the way back down and into the crowd. You would think that this is a place where people would come and spend 15, 20 seconds and keep moving -- no way. This is a one-hour exhibit for everybody because the scene keeps changing over and over and over. Different fish will come by, and it's quite an experience, Daryn.\",\n",
      "            \"Chad, quick question for you. I hear that in some ways they're a victim of their own success -- all the national publicity, that the Web site's been overloaded and it's tough to get through on the phones. Have they addressed those problems?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, you know, you can still walk straight up to the ticket counter right now and still get in. There's a maximum of 5,000 people in at any one time. When you get to that 5,000 maximum, then they're going to start putting people in line, they're going to start queuing them up outside. But, yes, they have had such international publicity, not just national publicity here -- this being the biggest aquarium ever. Bernie Marcus actually visited 30 other aquariums across the globe in 17 days, with all the other founders of this place, looking for the best things in all of the other best aquariums. And he tried to put all of those things in just one place, and this is it. This is the Georgia Aquarium.\",\n",

      "            \"It's a logical question. I think the thing to keep in mind is that scientists can't link any one specific event, or even two events back to back like this, to climate change. We can't say that global warming caused Katrina or Rita, but they could well have been made worse by climate change. They could have been more devastating and more intense because of global warming.\",\n",
      "            \"Is there a natural cycle to hurricanes?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, there's absolutely a natural cycle to hurricanes. And there's no evidence yet that the frequency of hurricanes would be different because of climate change. We have cycles. They last for a couple of decades at a time. We had them in the early 1900s, in the mid 1900s, and then now we've had them since 1995, a very high rate of hurricanes, relatively speaking, but we're in the middle of that cycle now. So we can't say that climate change has necessarily made them more frequent, but there is new evidence, reports in \\\"Science\\\" and \\\"Nature,\\\" to say that hurricanes are actually becoming more intense, and we're more likely to see category-four and five hurricanes because of global warming, because of the warming of the oceans.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, let's talk about warmer ocean temperatures. The warm waters are the things that fuel the hurricanes.\",\n",
      "            \"Precisely.\",\n",
      "            \"And you're finding that the oceans where the hurricanes develop are like a degree warmer?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, exactly. On average, the globe has already warmed one degree Fahrenheit. And we expect future warming because of antroprogenic (ph) emissions, because of the human emissions of greenhouse gases, CO2, carbon dioxide from cars and from power plants and from that kind of thing, and that has warmed the atmosphere already one degree Fahrenheit, and the oceans as well. The temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico were actually between one and two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they otherwise would be when Katrina moved from class one to class-five hurricane.\",\n",
      "            \"You know, Vicki, there are people that don't buy into the whole global-warming argument, and they say this is a natural evolution of the Earth, and if things are changing, the earth has always changed even before dinosaurs, and that man is not even strong enough to put things into the environment to effect change.\",\n",
      "            \"Right, Daryn. But certainly there have been cycles and there have been other things like sun activity that have generated changes in the past. But we are putting large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, more than otherwise would be there, and so therefore we're creating more of a greenhouse effect. The natural greenhouse effect lets us live on this planet. We're glad for that. But the emissions of fossil fuels are creating a blanket, if you will, that's warming the Earth at a quite fast rate, and that's why we're seeing some of the changes that we're seeing, at the staggering rates that we're seeing, where we have glaciers melting, ice sheets breaking off, the permafrost in Alaska not being permanent anymore. And we signs like European heatwaves, and perhaps now the intensification of hurricane activity from climate change.\",\n",

Right now, across the country, a lot of people have different top priorities. I believe that the Russians meddled in the elections last year. I'm greatly concerned about the cybersecurity component of it. There have been aspects of this investigation that's come out where it was once reported that Director Comey went to Rod Rosenstein asking for additional resources to expand the Russian investigation and Rod Rosenstein said that wasn't true. And then it turned out that wasn't true. So, I mean, we also have to be careful about the different reporting that comes out by anonymous sources, because sometimes a story comes out and it's spot on accurate, and we're learning something new that we didn't learn before. And other times a story comes out, and it turns out after more vetting that it's not true. Now, the president knows a lot more than I do as far as whether or not there was any type of additional activities between the Trump campaign and the Russians, but if there was nothing else there, and I was in his shoes, I would obviously be infuriated as well because I'd rather be talking about how the stock market just passed $22,000 (ph), all these jobs were created and unemployment is at a lower level. But these investigations are taking place, and if there's anything new to come out that's pertinent, we're all going to find out about it.

A unit of Nepalese troops arrives, with very basic tools, an attempt to excavate the cadavers of livestock buried under the rubble.

Everyone else is out in the plains,\\\" Mikhol says. They feel safer there and we soon find out why. Suddenly, the entire mountain shakes. There was just a sizable tremor.

We've also been told that the president is going to talk about the alleged link between Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi regime and Al Qaeda. This is an argument that didn't gain much traction in the fall.

Now today, one indicator showed consumer confidence hitting a nine-year low in January, and that means shoppers may be putting off some purchases. Meanwhile, investors really want little to do with stocks, and it means businesses see very little reason to expand and add jobs in this uncertain environment. So tonight, when President Bush speaks, the nation's workers, employee, employers, investors will be listening carefully, they'll be looking for some word on just how the president plans to jumpstart the economy. Now it's expected that the president will pitch a $674 billion economic plan. So What does that mean for the individual? Well, this plan is loaded with tax cuts. Let's start first with the highlights. We'll have the marriage tax, the proposal to scrap the so-called marriage penalty who hurts working couples who file jointly. The president also wants to boost the child care tax credit. It's $600. He'd like it to go to $1,000. Now the White House says these and other moves will put more than $1,000 back in the pockets of more than 90 million taxpayers. The president is again expected to call for eliminating taxes on stock dividends, saying it will boost investment and create jobs. Critics say it's benefit is more psychological than practical. Now over the last few days, we've been out speaking to people here in New York about what they would like to hear from the president tonight on the economy, and here's what they told us.\",\n",

      "            \"All right, Greg Clarkin, thank you. Now in the preview that he gave this morning, Mr. Bush did mention that he'll talk about American health. He spoke of what he called a modern health care system that is especially geared toward seniors. Also in New York today, our medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Hi, Sanjay.\",\n",
      "            \"Hey, good afternoon, Kyra. Yes, there are three really hot issues that are probably going to be part of the State of the Union and part of the president's message on health care. Take a quick look at them. You can see prescription drug benefits for seniors. We talked a lot about that. No question that will probably be topping the list, modernizing Medicare, access to health care, all sort of big issues. But with the prescription drug coverage, you know, when Medicare actually came about in the '60s, prescription drugs were not that big a part of the overall health care cost, and fast forward 35 years, and certainly prescription drugs are a huge part of that. A lot of these seniors on Medicare not getting adequate coverage for their prescription drugs. Take a look at how the United States sort of stacks up overall around the world in terms of cost of drugs. Certainly in the United States, drugs are more expensive here on average, a lot of different reasons for that. And if you take a look at some of the most common drugs out there, that especially a lot of our seniors are taking, again, in the United States, compared to Canada, a huge increase in the pricers over here in the United States. Now, there have been a lot of concern about this. The president has talked about different plans try and offer prescription drug coverage to seniors, and not making seniors choose between buying food, paying rent and actually buying drugs. Here are a couple of the options that the president is actually talking about, has talked about, may again mention tonight. First of all, just the existing fee-for-service program. That's the existing Medicare program, the way it stands today. But a little more controversial is option number two, which is actually the privatization of some of these programs, actually offering seniors a prescription drug plan if they actually offer to go to a private program, such as a private HMO, and finally, just private plans with prescription benefits overall, completely opting out of Medicare. Kyra, this is a hugely controversial point. It has been for quite some time. Barbara Kennelly, who is president of the National Commission for the Preservation of Social Security and Medicare -- that's a mouthful -- but this is what she says: \\\"Prescription drug benefits for current beneficiaries should not be held hostage by the requirement to enroll in a private plan.\\\" Basically, in a nutshell, Kyra, what she's saying, what the controversy is, should we sort of be holding hostage seniors by actually encouraging them to go to a private program, not giving them the stability of Medicare by sort of enticing them with a prescription drug coverage plan. There are two very different points of view on that. We'll hear more about probably tonight -- Kyra.\",\n",

WTOP, our radio affiliate in Washington, D.C., is reporting that two packages have exploded in two Maryland State government buildings. One package was at the Jeffrey Building on Francis Street in Annapolis. Another one was at the Maryland Department of Transportation Building in Hanover. A government official says no one was hurt in either incident, but we are working on getting details of two package explosions inside Maryland government buildings, one of them in a Department of Transportation office and one at the Jeffrey Building in Annapolis. You are looking -- that's WBAL, our affiliate. That does not look like Annapolis right there, so that may be the one that's at the Jeffrey Building. This is Hanover, Maryland, that you're looking at right now. You can see a lot of emergency vehicles on location. We do have the initial information that we have. WTOP, our CNN Radio affiliate in Washington, also reporting no injuries reported in the two explosions. But apparently, the explosions did take place inside the buildings. So, two packages. That's what we know at the moment. We do apparently have -- I don't know if I saw another shot from Annapolis, Valerie (ph). Is this the one we're looking at right now? WBAL. This is Hanover, Maryland. This was a Department of Transportation -- a Maryland Department of Transportation building. We're at the mercy of our affiliate's helicopter there. We're thankful for it, but I can't tell you exactly what we're pointing at the moment, or whether that is the building that we're talking about. Most of the emergencies -- most of the emergency vehicles seem to be centered around something a little bit closer than building where the explosion may have taken place. You can see there where Hanover and Annapolis are. Annapolis, obviously the state capital. We're moving in there. All right. So that is the -- OK. So that is the building that we were looking at right there, the large building, what you saw in the aerial photographs. That's the Maryland Department of Transportation headquarters in Hanover, Maryland. We're taking a look now through Street View to get a sense of what it is. OK. So that's the building. We were looking at it. That is the building that we're talking about. It does appear that there's no activity at the building. There were a lot of emergency vehicles parked some distance away from that building. Again, officials are telling us there were two blasts, two different government buildings in Maryland, but that there were no injuries in either package explosion. One of them that you're looking at right now, in Hanover, Maryland, that's a live picture from there. Another one in Annapolis. It's something called the Jeffrey Building. We're finding out what the Jeffrey Building is, what government activity took place there. In this particular case, it is a Department of Transportation -- a Maryland Department of Transportation building that we're looking at. The building appears to be just further up from what you're looking at right now. If the camera were to pan up, you would see it tilt up. You would see it. But right now you're seeing those emergency vehicles. And it does appear that there have been no injuries. We're glad to hear that. But we're staying on top of it with our affiliates, WBAL and our D.C. CNN Radio affiliate, WTOP, to find out what, if anything, authorities know about those packages, whether there's any information at all at this stage about where they were sent, how they were discovered, how they detonated, who was around when they detonated. At the moment, this is all the information we have right now. I'm just checking to see as new information is coming into us what we've got, because we've got our affiliate, WTOP, providing most of the reporting on this. Again, the building in Annapolis was the Jeffrey Building on Francis Street, for those of you who know Annapolis, Maryland. The one that we're looking at right now, however, is in Hanover, Maryland. That is the most information I've got right now. OK. Let me just tell you a little bit more about this. The building in Annapolis, the Jeffrey Building, is the State House office building. The one in Hanover that you're looking at now is a Department of Transportation headquarters for the Maryland Department of Transportation. We are getting this information via the affiliate, WBAL. Apparently, this is attributed to the Annapolis mayor, Joshua Cohen, telling us that the Jeffrey Building, an explosion occurred in Annapolis, Maryland, is the State House office building. All right. I'm now getting information -- my executive producer is telling me that that is not necessarily the case. Kelly (ph), tell me what you know about Jeffrey Building. The Office of Homeland Security is in the Jeffrey Building in Annapolis, and the secretary of state for Maryland is in the Jeffrey Building. That's what we know right now. So it may not be -- initial reports may not be that it is the State House building. We are understanding that's the Office of Homeland Security for Maryland and the secretary of state. This is a building in Annapolis. The one you're looking at now is not that one. The one you're looking at right now is WBAL. That's from our affiliate in Baltimore, WBAL of Hanover, Maryland. And it's the Department of Transportation headquarters. You can see emergency vehicles on the site. We've seen that helicopter sort of tilt up and pan to the left to give us a sense of that building. But that's the information that we have. We're now looking at -- I'm just going to push in and show you where Hanover, Maryland, is. That's Hanover. That's not Annapolis. That's Annapolis right there. OK. So that's Annapolis. That will be the Jeffrey Building that we're looking at. I'm just getting some more information right now to tell you about that site that you're looking at. All right. So I'm looking at the site of what is in the Jeffrey Building. I'm just scanning through that. It is the -- let me just look through this list. Secretary of Appointments is in that building, the secretary of state is in that building, the Office of Homeland Security is in that building. That's what I can mostly make out. It is 16 Francis Street in Annapolis, Maryland, for those of you who know. And Annapolis is one of those state capitals that is -- it's an old colonial town that's very tightly woven. So, all of these streets are very close to the state capital, which is in that round- about that you can see on the top of the screen. So I can't make out -- I don't know Annapolis well enough to know where the street actually is, which one of those streets it actually is, 16 Francis Street. And I can't make it out from where we are. But that is Annapolis that you're looking at. So, two explosions in two different places in Maryland. Both of them did actually detonate inside two government buildings. One is the -- a government building in Annapolis, the state capital. The other one is the Maryland Department of Transportation office in Hanover. And that's the one you're looking at right now. OK. So let me -- I'm just trying to get some more information on this right now. But we are looking at live pictures from WBAL, our affiliate there. I'm getting a little more clarity. My colleague, Jim Acosta, is letting me know as we're trying to locate the Annapolis location that initially we had said -- I was telling you that it's near the State House. It is across the street from the State House. The Jeffrey building is across the street from the State House in Annapolis. Now, again, we've got two pictures going on here because we don't have live pictures from Annapolis just yet. What we do have is live pictures from Hanover. That is the building right there. That's the Maryland Department of Transportation headquarters on the right side of your screen, one of the two buildings in which a package has detonated. What we are hearing from government officials and through our CNN D.C. Radio affiliate, WTOP, is that there were blasts at both buildings, but that no one was injured in either of the blasts. We are still trying to determine what exploded, what type of blasts they were, how big, and how damaging they were. But what we do understand is that nobody was injured in either of those explosions. Now, here is a picture. This is not -- these are not live TV pictures. We're looking at Google Earth here. These are pictures of Annapolis. Now, you see the State House right in the center there and all of those streets that go off of it. This explosion was at a building that is across the road from the State House. Again, Jim was just helping me out. Jim Acosta was just helping me out by letting me know where it was. But there's the State House. And there are a number of streets leading up to it, sort of up a hill. And there are buildings that -- government buildings that surround it. One of those buildings is the Jeffrey Building. That is -- that houses a number of government offices, including the Maryland Office of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State's Office. Very, very -- information is sort of trickling in at the moment from our various sources, and we are thankful to WBAL, our Baltimore affiliate, for getting us pictures of Hanover through their helicopter that you're looking at right now. And for WTOP, our D.C. radio affiliate, who is doing a lot of the reporting on this to try to let us know what's going on. If you are out there and you do know what's going on, send me a tweet @AliVelshi, or post it up to my Facebook, and we will follow up on all of these leads to find out what exactly is going on there. This is Francis Street in Annapolis, Maryland, where the Annapolis explosion was. In Baltimore, we're going to find out a little bit more information. Those of you who know the Maryland Department of Transportation building -- and I suppose if you're in that part of Maryland, it's sort of a building everybody will know because you have to go there probably for your licenses -- that's what we're looking at. So we're alternating between the two spots. This is now Annapolis again Two explosions inside state of Maryland government buildings. Apparently, no injuries. We don't know what it was that blew up. But apparently, they took place inside government buildings. Not the State House. We're showing you Annapolis. And if you know Annapolis, that's sort of a big landmark there, other than the naval institutions. But the State House is not where the explosion took place. It took place on Francis Street, at the Jeffrey Building, which is home to the secretary of state, home to the homeland security offices there, and other -- numerous other offices. We don't know yet exactly which other offices they are. Now, these two buildings are both state of Maryland building, the Department of Transportation headquarters, and a place where there would be other senior Maryland government officials. So it is unclear what the motivation would be to target those two buildings. Annapolis, about -- less than an hour's drive from Washington, D.C. Now you're looking at Hanover there and the complex that houses the Maryland Department of Transportation headquarters. So we have no information yet coming to us about what it is. Now, let me tell you more -- OK. So we have been reporting -- again, this is all very, very new information. We've been reporting no injuries. There are conflicting reports now that a mail room employee may have been injured. We are working -- because this is breaking news, we are working to clarify information as we go along. But this is -- this may have happened at the State House in Annapolis. Again, lots of conflicting information. We had first heard that the explosion was at the State House. We are now told it is at the Jeffrey Building, which is across the street from the State House on Francis Street. We do know that the bomb squad -- or this is what we're told -- was investigating the incident. The FBI were on their way when the incident took place. This would have been about 1:00 Eastern. This is information that I'm getting from \\\"The Baltimore Sun.\\\" But again, I have to tell you, this is -- we're getting new information momentarily, and some of it is conflicting. So all we seem to know is that something blew up at the Annapolis -- the Jeffrey Building in Annapolis. There were also reports on the other picture. This is -- this is -- are we still on Annapolis? Let's see that WBAL picture for a second. This is the Maryland Department of Transportation. Again, according to \\\"The Baltimore Sun\\\" -- and they're not -- they're saying that they got this from other media sources. According to \\\"The Baltimore Sun,\\\" there were injuries at the Maryland Department of Transportation. We're putting in calls to various people in these towns to find out what they know. Apparently, the fire department in the county may have been responding to an explosion when -- they don't know what it is. They don't know what it is. Initial reports say that it might have been a chemical explosion. OK. Let's go back now to Annapolis for a second. And I'll just keep on informing you of what I know, what new information is coming in. Again, these are all reports -- and I'm getting some information now through \\\"The Baltimore Sun.\\\" The Jeffrey Building, which is across from the State House in Annapolis, includes a number of gubernatorial staff offices, as well as the Office of Homeland Security, the Office of Appointments, and the secretary of state. So it's an important Maryland state building in Annapolis, Maryland, the state capital. That is the State House. These are Google images that we're showing you. Anybody who's been to Annapolis knows that that part of town is centered around the State House. A slight incline, a bit of a hill to get up there, and government offices surround it. So, obviously in a case like this, there is going to be conflicting information, but we are trying to get as much new and accurate information as possible. I've got everything open here. So if you have information and you want to tweet me, @AliVelshi, if you're near there, let me know what you see. Let me know what you're hearing or what you've even heard on local media outlets. So I'll update you with what we know now. You're looking at a picture of Hanover, Maryland. This is coming to us from our affiliate WBAL. And it is the parking area, the road, basically, outside of the Maryland Department of Transportation, where apparently there was an explosion. We do not know what exploded. We had heard initially that there were no injuries at all. We are hearing conflicting reports because that's what happens when things happen. Various news organizations get different pieces of information. We have conflicting reports about injuries in both places. So we don't know. In the case of the other location, in Annapolis, we heard reports that someone may have been injured in a mail room in the State House, but we're now learning that the explosion wasn't in the State House, it was across the road from the State House. I did receive a tweet from somebody whose dad works at the Naval Academy, the other big presence, obviously, in Annapolis, Maryland, and said they had heard no explosion, no idea of an explosion, or no information about the explosions. I'm just reading through my information to see if there's anything else that we have about these explosions. OK. So what we're looking at there is -- we're pushing in on Google to Hanover, Maryland, the Maryland Department of Transportation. They are -- officials -- there seems to be some movement there. There seems to be some people on the ground, but there doesn't seem to be anybody near the building at all. We showed you a picture of the Maryland Department of Transportation headquarters. It's seems to be completely devoid of activity at this point. So whatever is happening doesn't seem to be happening with great urgency at the moment. It seems to have been over an hour since this was first reported. Now we're getting more information from a different source that people have been injured at this particular one that you're looking at. This is courtesy of our affiliate in Baltimore, WBAL. There are some reports that there have been injuries there. There are also reports that this may have been an improvised explosive device. Let's go to -- what town is that in, Kelly (ph)? All right. I've got somebody on the phone. Josh Stewart, are you there?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, I'm here. How are you doing?\",\n",
      "            \"Good, Josh. Where are you?\",\n",
      "            \"I am in downtown Annapolis, not too far from the state building.\",\n",
      "            \"OK. Tell me what you know.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, here's what's going on. There's been a suspicious package at a state office building right by the State House. And there was some sort of an explosion. I'm not sure at this point how large it was. And we're receiving conflicting reports about whether the person that opened the package in the mail room was injured.\",\n",
      "            \"OK. Just give me a bit of the geography. We're looking at it right now on Google. We're looking at a view that shows me basically a lot of streets leading up to the state capitol, to the front entrance of the state capitol. Where would this Jeffrey Building be? Where is this Francis Street?\",\n",
      "            \"Francis Street is -- if you're looking at Google Maps, and, you know, right down that State House, you can see on the one side what looks like a statue.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes.\",\n",
      "            \"The statue is staring right down Francis Street.\",\n",
      "            \"OK.\",\n",
      "            \"And you see Main Street, the big road there. It's off to the right.\",\n",
      "            \"So if I'm looking at it, it's to the right of -- OK. So we see it. We've got a dot there that shows the Jeffrey Building. An important building? A building that a lot of people spend a lot of time in during the day?\",\n",
      "            \"You know, it's mostly state employees. I mean, every now and then, you know, a regular citizen will have business there. But it's a lot of bureaucratic work that goes on there. The Department of State is there, and they do a lot of paperwork related to some of the corporate filings and stuff like that. But it's not a place like the DMV, where everyone has business.\",\n",
      "            \"Right. And the other explosion we're hearing about in Hanover is at a Department of Transportation office. Again, it looks like an office building, so I don't know whether they do things like licenses and things like that. But this is not necessarily a public building, the Jeffrey Building, but it is obviously home to a number of important offices. We're hearing about the Office of Homeland Security and the secretary of state in Maryland. Josh, please stand by. See what information you can gather on this, because we need to get some new information. I'm going to just take us over now to the president of the United States with his announcement about William Daley.\",\n",
      "            \"-- most trusted aides to step into the breach and lead us through a very difficult time. And I also ask Pete to help us think about how the White House should be structured and run over the next two years. Thanks in no small part to his efforts, a period that everybody thought would be one of retrenchment turned out to be one of great progress for our country. And Pete's leadership is all the more remarkable when you consider that when I first met him and asked him to lead my Senate staff, he told me in that gruff voice of his that his strong inclination was to leave government.\",\n",
      "            \"The reason everybody is applauding is because they've heard him say that every day -\",\n",
      "            \"-- they've heard him say that everyday for the last six years. And yet each time I have asked him to accept one more assignment, he's saddled up and he's taken the job. And it's fair to say that I would not be where I am today without his extraordinary counsel. Pete didn't volunteer to serve as interim chief of staff. He made it clear that that was not his preference, but he accepted the responsibility. And as he oversaw our strategy during the lame duck session of Congress, he also was working to develop a structure and a plan for the next two years that I believe will serve the White House and more importantly, the American people very well. One of those assignments was providing me recommendations for candidates to serve as chief of staff moving forward. As part of that process, today I am proud to announce the appointment of an experienced public servant, a devoted patriot, my friend, fellow Chicagoan, Bill Daley to serve as my chief of staff.\",\n",
      "            \"Few Americans can boast the breadth of experience that Bill brings to this job. He's served as a member of President Clinton's cabinet as commerce secretary. He took on several other important duties on behalf of our country. He's led major corporations. He possesses a deep understanding of how jobs are created and how to grow our economy. And needless to say, Bill also has a smidgen of awareness of how our system of government and politics works. You might say it is a genetic trait. But most of all, I know Bill to be somebody who cares deeply about this country. Believes in its promise and considers no calling higher and more important than serving the American people. He will bring his tremendous experience, his strong values, and forward-looking vision to this White House. I'm convinced that he'll help us in our mission of growing our economy and moving America forward, and I very much look forward to working with Bill in the years to come. Before I ask Bill to say a few words, I should also confess that I have prevailed once again on Pete's sense of duty or sense of guilt, I'm not sure which. And I'm grateful that he has agreed to one more tour of duty as my counselor for the next two years.\",\n",
      "            \"Now, as you might have noticed, people like Pete. He is a unique and indespensible asset to me and this administration. I cannot imagine life here without him. And I told him so. And I'm delighted that we're able to keep him a little bit longer. I'll be making further announcements in the days and weeks ahead. And I am absolutely confident that we will have a great team that's equal to America's task in the years to come. But with that, what I'd like to do is to introduce my new chief of staff, Bill Daley.\",\n",
      "            \"Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you very much, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. You have honored me and my family by giving me an opportunity to serve you and to serve our nation. Fifty years ago this month, I visited the White House with my parents. And my brothers and sisters to visit a young president who went on to show great strength, leadership and vision in the face of enormous challenges in those times. You, Mr. President, have proven your strength, your leadership, your vision during a most difficult time for our nation and for the world. You have also shown through your example that public service is an honorable calling, and I am pleased to answer your call. I look forward to working with the wonderful staff, which you have assembled. I know my job will be made easier by the great work and direction of Pete Rouse. The direction and great work he has provided over these past couple of months, and the president talked about the enormous successes under Pete's watch. Pete, too, has dedicated his life to public service and to our nation, and I am grateful for his efforts and I am proud to call him my colleague. I assure you, Mr. President, as they have done in the last two years, that this team will not let you down, nor the nation. Thank you very much for this extreme honor.\",\n",
      "            \"Okay. President Obama announcing William Daley, former commerce secretary, son of long-time Chicago mayor -- as his new chief of staff. And congratulating Pete Rouse, who came in as interim chief of staff after Rahm Emmanuel, decided that he is going to leave, go back to Chicago to run for mayor. So, remarkable interconnectiveness with Chicago, the place where the president has lived for a long time. All right. Let's go back to that other story that we are following. I'll give you an update on the two explosions that have taken place in the -- in Maryland. This picture is coming to us from WBAL. It is in Hanover, Maryland. Outside of the headquarters of the Maryland Department of Transportation. Here's what we know. This is one of two explosions that have taken place. A Maryland state government official has told CNN there are some injuries in the incidents. He describes them as very minor. There are two packages. Basically, one of them went to the building we were just showing you, that site that we were just showing you. This is the Maryland Department of Transportation headquarters. That's the building on the right side. One went to that mailroom. The other one went to the Jeffrey building, which is a block away, across the road from the state house in Annapolis, Maryland. There's the state house you're looking at. You see the red dot, just a little below that, that's the Jeffrey Building. We are told that they were not big explosions. They were packages. We don't know what the packages are. Both buildings have been evacuated. A source has told CNN that -- something happened. They detonated, flame was emitted. The source talking to CNN felt that it might be too strong to call them blasts. But we still have details coming in. One of the details we have coming in is that Annapolis, there may be one injury there as well. There do appear to be some injuries. Let's go to Jeanne Meserve who is following this along with us from Washington. Jeanne, what do you know?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, Ali, what we're hearing is that explosion might be too strong a word to describe what happened with these two packages. However, they did ignite. These devices went off. We're told by one law enforcement source that flames were emitted. One individual was trying to deal with one of the packages and did at least -- one person sustained injuries. Those were burns to their hands. Now, this is a Maryland incident. The Maryland State Police are taking the lead. The FBI is also responding. The Department of Homeland Security says it is aware. It's closely monitoring reports, but at this point in time, this is a Maryland state incident at this point. These two devices, the only ones we've heard about so far, Ali.\",\n",
      "            \"Okay, Jeanne. Stand by. Let's bring Fran Townsend in. She's a national security contributor, joining us from New York. Fran, what I haven't told our viewers, if they've just joined us, is that the Jeffrey Building, the one in Annapolis, across from the state house, housed homeland security and it housed the secretary of state. The other building was the -- in Hanover, Maryland, was the Maryland department of Transportation headquarters. What comes to your mind when you hear these two places as targets? What does that mean?\",\n",
      "            \"You know, it's really hard to understand or explain right now, Ali. I was talking to a very senior law enforcement source, federal law enforcement source who had firsthand knowledge of the investigation. He said, look, these packages ignited. As Jeanne just pointed out, too strong to probably call it a blast. But this was just a surprise. Suggesting to me, Ali, that it wasn't related to an ongoing investigation that they know of yet. Clearly, as Maryland -- Maryland are the first responders. The federal officials are now trying to look at this and figure out do we know anything that might be useful to help Maryland as they continue to try and understand who might be behind this and why those particular buildings.\",\n",
      "            \"Fran, stand by. Let's go back to Jeanne Meserve. Jeanne, what have you got?\",\n",
      "            \"We've got new information from a government source. According to this individual, the package at the Jeffrey Street address flashed with a little bit of fire. The package emitted what was described as a s sulfur smell. A person there was slightly injured. The other package was at the Maryland Department of Transportation headquarters, as you know, near BWI airport. That resulted in an injury, we're told. According to this source, the reports of these two devices came in not simultaneously but very close. Precautions have been taken at state facilities all across Maryland. The FBI, Maryland state police and the Maryland fire marshals are now all responding to these incidents. But we should caution you here, these are early reports. Early reports, as I know -- Fran can tell us better than anyone are often incorrect. But that's the early picture we're getting now.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, that's -- thank you, Jeanne. You work in a beat, Jeanne, where you're often called upon to talk about things where we have very little information. Fran, I'm just looking at my some tweets. Some of them are helping me out, gathering information. Other people are saying, don't you guys know what you're talking about? This is exactly the case, though. When you have things like this, you have something detonating or flames coming out of it at two different buildings not terribly far from each other. At what point does the information become solid where we have a sense of whether this was a terror attack? Was it someone with a gripe? How do you make sense of fast moving information like this?\",\n",
      "            \"Ali, the first thing they're going to try to do is try to look at the remnants, what's left of each of these devices. They'll look at the sophistication, they'll look at what was the detonation device, what was the material used to get the flash or the ignition. And all of that will tell you something more about the bombmaker. Was it a disgruntled employee? Or was this some organized group that had some agenda or message that they were trying to get out? You know, until we know more from the scenes, from the actual the facts of the investigation, it's hard to know which this would be.\",\n",
      "            \"Okay. We'll continue to lean on you and Jeanne Meserve. Fran Townsend and Jeanne Meserve, thanks very much for helping us out on this. We'll keep an eye on this situation, obviously. As we get more information on these two explosions -- whatever they were, these two - something -- that happened at two Maryland government buildings, we'll bring that back to you as soon as we have it. We're going to take a quick break. We'll be right back.\"\n",

These, of course, come in the wake of the police killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Now protesters across the country have taken to the streets again, demanding an end to police brutality as well as action from lawmakers. And there's a Congressman from Georgia who's really helped lead that chorus. Take a listen.\",\n",
      "            \"It feels like open season on black men in America, and I'm outraged. In fact, all Americans are at risk when bad actors in law enforcement use their guns instead of their heads. Despite bipartisan nationwide calls for action and despite my bills to reform the broken grand jury process, hold police accountable, and end militarization and despite my colleague's bills to encourage body cameras, this Congress does nothing.\",\n",

      "            \"I think first of all, something that a lot of people don't know is there's actually no federal database that tracks how many people are killed by police. So the closest thing we have is this nonprofit that's been collecting data through police reports and citizen tips, fatalencounters.org. If I may, let me run through some numbers. It found, most recently, in 2014, more than 1100 people were killed by police, 414 were white, 233 were African-American, and just to be totally clear, this database actually doesn't account for guilt or innocence or armed and unarmed. We heard you on the floor saying this is, \\\"open season on black men,\\\" a hunting term. Congressman, is it not dangerous to use that kind of language?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I said that it felt like it was open season, and it really does. I think if you are a black male and you've grown up in the inner cities, as I have, and you have matriculated to this point in life, I think most black males feel the same way. I just simply expressed a sentiment that is very common. But I would take issue with those statistics that you mentioned. Every time I see statistics from one source or the other, it's always a different number in terms of how many police killings have occurred in a given year.\",\n",
      "            \"It's true. That's because there are no actual hard numbers. I've even tried looking at the CDC numbers and those are even tough as well. I agree with you there. That needs to change. But back to your point on how this is open season, here's the thing. What's implied in that, what you're not saying but implying, is that broad strokes on all police are the hunters out to kill. Is that really fair?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, yes, I think it's a fair depiction of what's happening in society today. We find an overabundance -- and we have got video evidence of black males who are being shot and killed by police officers. Now, that doesn't include the numbers who are being wounded, nor does it include the people who Tasers are being used upon, which may or may not be necessary in a given situation. So what we have is we're seeing black males. We don't see any other demographic being inordinately singled out for this kind of misconduct.\",\n",
      "            \"I was talking to a man just the other night on our 10:00 show who is not African-American, who's the man who was beaten and Tased in a desert after granted -- eluding police and running and jumping on a horse. So he was not African-American, and we have absolutely run that video here at CNN. Here's my next question, though. And I'm with you. I agree that, for example, the case in North Charleston involving Walter Scott was absolutely outrageous. We've covered enough of these to see, Congressman, that a number of these suspects are resisting arrest or are fleeing police.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, nobody deserves to die for committing or attempting to commit a misdemeanor or some offense that does not place in jeopardy the life of a police officer. And we've just simply had too many episodes where people are quick to pull the trigger and ask questions later. That's the problem that we have in this country, and it always seems to be the black male who is\"\n",

      "        \"utt\": [\n",
      "            \"Welcome back to a special edition of CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson in Jerusalem, where it's just before 6:20 in the evening. This week, we are bringing you special editions of CONNECT THE WORLD live from the holy city. The Israeli Prime Minister speaking out on growing violence in the Middle East. As citizens cast their ballots in the second-high stakes election in just five months. Benjamin Netanyahu answered a question by saying that Israel is well-prepared should any provocation come from Iran. Now this comes after the U.S. President said it looks like Tehran is behind this weekend's attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil suppliers. A source familiar with the investigation tells CNN U.S. and Saudi investigators have determined there is a very high probability that the strikes were carried out by low altitude cruise missiles, likely launched from an Iranian base. However, no evidence of those claims has been made public as of yet. And we have just learned from a U.S. source that Saudi officials have recovered fully intact circuit boards from one of the weapons. Let's get the latest from the region. CNN's Nic Robertson joining us from Saudi Arabia, and our Nick Paton Walsh is live in Iran. Let's start with you in Riyadh, Nic, and what is this latest that have from Saudi officials and what are their options at this point?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, Becky. Saudi officials are saying that the weapons systems were made in Iran. That they continue to investigate where those weapons systems were fired from. They say they weren't fired from Yemen. What the source with knowledge of the investigation says is that some of the weapons systems that were fired at the Saudi oil facility fell short, landed in the desert north of the oil facility and weren't fully damaged. And this seems to have led to the recovery of parts of those weapons systems, including those circuit boards. Just to give our viewers a little bit of context here. Along with my CNN team, early last year, Saudi authorities showed us cruise missiles fired by Houthis from Yemen, again, these missiles today not fired from Yemen. But the Saudis showed us -- we were the first journalists to be shown these cruise missiles -- that they said were constructed and were made in part in Iran using Iranian technology. And they pointed to the circuit boards and they were examining the circuit boards, they were examining the components on those circuit boards. And they then sent on that equipment to the U.N. and the U.N. determined indeed that as the Saudi's had alleged this was manufactured -- believed to be manufactured in Iran. The situation we're at here, the Saudis again, along with the U.S. investigators, a joint effort here on the ground, are looking at circuit boards and components within these only partially damaged missile systems. They'll be able to look at the rocket motors themselves. That will help them determine what range these weapons systems had. But I think key here is this high probability determination that these weapons systems were fired, launched from Iran, close to the border with Iraq, over Iran, over Kuwait, avoiding extensive radar systems, focused out into the Persian Gulf and approach these oil facilities over the desert -- Becky.\",\n",
      "            \"Right. Nick Paton Walsh, the drumbeat to hold Iran responsible then for the attacks does seem to be getting louder. What's the calculation in Tehran?\",\n",
      "            \"At this stage, we have not really had an up to date response today from the increasing detailed allegations. I have to say ones that are not accompanied with public evidence to back them up, that missiles were in fact launched from Iran. I should point out there's a huge difference between Iranian made, which is large number of anti-Western missiles in this region verses launched from Iranian territory. Which seems to be one supposition. But all along since Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, early on Saturday said in two tweets that Iran was responsible, Iran has denied that. The foreign minister, Javid Zarif, saying they've gone to the U.S. for maximum pressure, retching up sanctions to maximum deceit. And even last night, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran repeating the initial idea the Iranians had. That this was in fact the Yemeni Houthi rebels who themselves say they fired 10 drones at those Saudi oil refineries. They would have to have traveled across hundreds of miles of Saudi air defenses to get there. Iran though has taken a different tack today in a lengthy speech, the most authoritative voice here. It's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has come forward and answered one of the abiding questions about what may happen next here. Some thinking that perhaps U.S. posturing is essentially a negotiating tactic to get Iran to the table. The Ayatollah Khamenei has said fairly clearly that there will be no negotiation with the United States at any level. He goes on to say because Donald Trump has, the U.S. President, vacillated between whether he has preconditions or no conditions for talks. His officials occasionally contradicting him. The Ayatollah goes on to say, sometimes they -- Trump officials -- say negotiation without preconditions, sometimes they say with 12 conditions. Such remarks are either due to their turbulent politics or a trip to confuse others. He says the Iranian government is unanimous and he holds out the kind of unlikely, perhaps humiliating for Trump -- certainly the idea of that if Trump apologized, withdrew his remarks and returned to the nuclear deal they might allow America back into the multilateral talks. But Iranian officials waiting for the evidence, waiting for basically details to explain how U.S. and Saudi officials have got to this conclusion. A tense region, though definitely -- Becky.\",\n",
      "            \"OK, Nick Paton Walsh, absolutely in Tehran for you. Nic Robertson is in Riyadh. We've just heard from a White House spokesperson. The White House can't say definitively that Iran was behind an attack on an oil facility in Saudi Arabia and is still in the process of making the case to the American people. The latest from Washington. Our coverage of the Israeli election continues in a moment. We'll be looking at the role that Donald Trump is playing in Israeli politics.

Hundreds also attended a memorial service for him earlier in the day. Nemtsov who served as Russia's deputy prime minister in the 1990s was shot and killed on a bridge near the Kremlin on Friday. The Moscow investigative committee has offered a 49,000 reward for information leading to his killer. Well, our senior international correspondent Ivan Watson has been following the ceremony. And he joins me now from the cemetery. Ivan, perhaps you can give us a sense of how it feels to be there.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, moments ago mourners buried the coffin of Boris Nemtsov. Several hundred people gathered there, including family members, of course, his mother who I believe is supposed to be celebrating her 88th birthday today, but instead if burying her son who was shot dead a stone's throw away from the walls of the Kremlin on Friday night. Also accompanying family members there, grieving family members, are a number of members of Russia's small largely marginalized and fractured opposition movement, many of whom have been saying that the killing, the assassination of Boris Nemtsov, is a symbol, is a sign that there may not be much of a room in modern-day Russia for a politician like him any more, somebody who criticized the Kremlin, who made accusations of corruption at the highest levels of the government and who spoke out vociferously against what he claimed was Russia's role in the war in neighboring Ukraine, that in today's Russia, which is facing sanctions from western countries, from Europe, which is increasingly isolated from the west and is in a rhetorical war with the west as well as with the government in neighboring Ukraine. and many critics point out in the Ukrainian government and western governments, may actually be sending troops and weapons to Russian backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, that there simply is not room for somebody to challenge the government of Vladimir Putin in today's Russia anymore, that this is a real wakeup call to what's left of an opposition that has largely been marginalized, does not enjoy much time on the Kremlin controlled state TV channels. And that now is being gunned down in the streets of the capital even though the Russian government has insisted that it will try to bring the killers to justice and has argued that this is a provocation by enemies of the Russian government aimed at destabilizing this country, even though supporters of Boris Nemtsov, they claim that the atmosphere and hatred and intolerance that has developed over the course of the past year, especially with the Ukraine conflict, that they argue that the Kremlins hands are all over this killing -- Manisha.\",\n",
      "            \"Ivan, so far as that investigations goes, what do we know at this time?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, there's been new video released today from some of the circuit cameras that bristle all over central Moscow showing what is purportedly the getaway car traveling through Moscow. One other video that was released, a very grainy that was released two days ago, showed what was purportedly the killer running away from Boris Nemtsov and jumping into a car that very impressive just happened to be driving past when the murder appeared to have taken place 11:30 p.m. in Friday. Russian investigators say they're still working through the cartridges that was found next to the body of Nemtsov. They're still working through the security camera videos. Nobody has been arrested, though, which is striking considering that this area right next to Red Square is probably one of the most heavily monitored, one of the most heavily guarded places arguably in the entire country, and yet the killer was able to carry out this crime and then speed away from the scene. And that is also -- has led to supporters of Nemtsov arguing that they don't feel that the government is sincere when it says it wants to bring the killers to justice. Now the key eyewitness who was Nemtsov's girlfriend, a 23-year-old Ukrainian model named Anna Duritskaya, as she flew back to Kiev, to her native Ukraine late last night after being questioned for three days by Russian investigators, she made an emotional public plea before she was allowed to go, saying please let me go I don't know why I'm being kept here. But of course she was closest, she was next to Nemtsov when he was gunned down. In a short television interview, she said that she really didn't see the killer who came up from behind her. She didn't see the make or the license plate of the getaway car. Once again she just repeated a plea to please be allowed to get home, and you can imagine the shock and the distress that she was going through, and yet how important her testimony would be to an unfolding investigation -- Manisha.\",\n",

It's also incredibly unlikely that the congressman can figure out exactly how he got infected, not without rigorous contract tracing and the kind of testing that's simply that taken place on Capitol Hill. A senior Republican aide tells CNN that Gohmert's positive test result caused issues on the Hill, with a lot of staffers ordered to get tests before being able to do anything else. And that process took the entire day. Remember, Gohmert was part of a committee hearing Tuesday, alongside many other lawmakers and Attorney General Bill Barr.

Remember, they told us a couple of weeks ago that they would be approving this vaccine on August 10th or even earlier than that. You know, despite the fact, as you mentioned, there's a whole load of concern, very deep and serious ones, about how safe this Russian vaccine will be, because human trials on it have not been completed. They won't be completed even before it's approved, which is astonishing. And how effective will it be? Because the results that Russia has got from its testing so far has not been made public, it's not open to peer review. That has not deterred, as I say, 20 countries including Brazil and India, countries with some of the highest rates of coronavirus infectious in the world from contacting Russia and saying, look, you know, we are interested in getting this vaccine.

A short time ago, the 43-year-old won the Masters, the fifth of his legendary career. It's also the 15th major victory of his career, only second to the great Jack Nicklaus. You're locking at those final moments right there of his victory, a sweet victory for Tiger Woods there. CNN's Don Riddell is in Augusta. So, Don, what an incredible culmination of a decades long, you know, drought, and now the ultimate comeback. Take us through it.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. It has just been absolutely extraordinary. The narrative that a lot of people were hoping for this week was that Tiger Woods would win again, but it still seems so far-fetched, especially since the feud was so stacked here and the quality of the golf on the leaderboard was incredibly high over these last four days, but Tiger Woods has done it again, and he deserves it, too. And this has just been the most extraordinary journey. You know, we've been speculating before his comeback what would it mean for golf if he could do it again, what would it mean for sports if he could do it again. We speculated it would be one of the greatest sporting comebacks of all time, but now that it's happened, now that we've actually seen it with our own eyes, it would be hard to find anything that rivals this. And these images you're seeing now of him celebrating on the 18th Green, they're absolutely wonderful, wonderful, wonderful moments. When he won his first Masters title here, his first of five green jackets back in 1997, his father was with him to see it, now his kids are here to see it, young Sam and young Charlie who hugged him when he came off the 18th Green. And they are one of the reasons that he wanted to comeback, to see if he could do it again, to see if he could contend again and win tournaments and win majors again and now he has done it with them watching on from the sidelines. It's kind of hard not to get emotional as a sports fan just kind of seeing that and just thinking about what that must mean for him and for them, an incredible journey.\",\n",

And what a moment that was, too, not just his family being there, but to see these galleries that would follow him, which was tremendous and then really I thought that was incredibly poignant to see all those green jacket wearers, you know, who were standing there, who were there to celebrate him and welcome back, you know, into that winning arena.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. I mean, you would expect to see all the members here around the 18th Green. But I think it's fair to say some winners are more popular than others and, of course, Tiger Woods, you know -- I mean, he's the most famous golfer on the planet. It would be easy to forget, perhaps, just how he used to dominate this sport once, how he transcended this sport, how everybody else used to turn up basically thinking the best they could hope for was second place. But since 2008, he has been through so much. Of course, the marital issues that have been well documented, the fall from grace, the DUI, that kind of awful mug shot, and then the physical issues he's had to deal with, you know, the back, four back operations, risky spinal fusion surgery. 16 months ago he was ranked almost 1,200th in the world. The body was shot, the confidence was completely gone, and even his most ardent of supporters were finding it harder and harder to make a case that he could come back and do it. When he spoke to the media at the Presidents Cup in New York at the end of 2017, he said just riding in a golf cart for him was painful. He said he really didn't even know if he could get out on a golf course and play without pain. The idea of playing without pain and contending and competing for tournaments and majors seemed incredibly far-fetched. But then, he did it, right? I mean in 2018, last year at the Open Championship in Britain, he was contending again. He was playing very well. The PGA Championship, he almost won it, he came second. And then he won the Tour Championship in Atlanta, which is the climax of the PGA Tour season just down the road here from Augusta in Georgia and that gave him so much confidence. That was the moment where I think he realized, wow, you know, I could actually do this again.\",\n",

I mean, that is absolutely redemption. Now, some people will look at the way he behaved and say you could never truly move on from that, you could never really expect anybody to forget that. But I think he's done everything that he possibly could to put that behind him to move on and to show that he's a better person, that he's older and wiser and more caring and, you know, the physical ailments as well.\",\n",

That's not something we've taken for granted for more than a decade. You know, one of the most impressive things about this win this week is the fact that all the guys chasing him were all major winners themselves, or many of them were. Certainly at the end of the third round last night, you looked at all the top names on the leaderboard, and they all knew what it was like to win a major. Back in the day, he was the only guy winning them. So, the competition is much tougher now.\",\n",

And I want to thank everybody who is part of that program, Father Brian for your guidance and prayers, for not being fazed by divine intervention, Bishop Miller for your spiritual and civic leadership, Janet Hines- Norris for that amazing performance. I want to thank our fire department, honor guard and thank all of our first responders for everything you do to keep us safe. Thank you, Renee Ferguson, for your mentorship and your passion for justice. And Mrs. Chismar, everyone should have at least one person in their lives who believes in them the way you believe in your students. To my fellow mayors, Mayor Cabaldon, Mayor Whaley and Mayor Adler, extraordinary leaders in the community of mayors as well as in their own cities and all of the current and former mayors here today, I thank you for your service at a time when local leadership has never mattered more. And I want to ask everyone here to help thank my unbelievable talented staff and volunteers each doing the work of 10 people, living out the values of this project and making it all possible. Thank you. Thank you to my mom who is here physically and my dad who is here in more ways than he could ever have imagined, and to Chasten, my love. And I'm pretty fond of him, too, for giving me the strength to do this and the grounding to be myself as we go. For everyone from around South Bend joining us today, thank you for giving me the chance to be Mayor Pete. And for everyone who came from far and wide, welcome to South Bend. It is a source of deep pleasure to be able to share our hometown with you. I'm glad that you can so it for yourself, because this city's story is such a big part of why I'm doing this. I grew up in South Bend in the same neighborhood where Chasten and I live today with our two dogs, Buddy and Truman. My father immigrated to this country because he knew it was the best place in the world to get an advanced education. He became an American citizen and met my mother, a young professor, who it the daughter of an army colonel and a piano teacher. And they moved here for work, settled into a house on the west side and pretty soon after that I came on the scene. The South Bend I grew up in was still recovering from economic disasters that had played out before I was even born. Once in this city we housed the companies that helped power America into the 20th century. Think of the forces that built this building we're standing in now, and the countless others like it now long gone. Think of the wealth that was created here. Picture the thousands of workers who came through these doors every day and the thousands of families that they provided for. And think what have must have been like that day in 1963 when the great Studebaker auto company collapsed and the shocked brought our city to its knees. Buildings like this one fell quiet and acres of land around us slowly became a rust escape of industrial decline, collapsing factories everywhere, houses that had been full of life and love and hope stood crumbling and vacant. And for the next half century, it took heroic efforts just to keep our city running as population shrank and young people like me grew up believing that the only way to a good life was to get out. And many of us did, but then some of us came back. We wanted things to change around here, and when the national press called us a dying city at the beginning of this decade, we took that as a call to arms. I ran for mayor in 2011 knowing that nothing like Studebaker would ever come back, but believing we would, our city would, if we had the courage to re-imagine our future. And now I can confidently say South Bend is back. More people are moving into South Bend than we've seen in a generation. Thousands of new jobs have been added in our area, billions in investment. Now, there's a long way for us to go, but we have changed our trajectory and shown a path forward for communities like ours, and that's why I'm here today, to tell a different story than make America great again. Because there's a myth being sold to industrial and rural communities, the myth that we can stop the clock and turn it back. It comes from people who think the only way to speak to communities like ours is through resentment and nostalgia. They're selling an impossible promise of returning to a bygone era that was never as great as advertised to begin with. The problem is that they're telling us to look for greatness in all the wrong places, because if there's one thing that the city of South Bend has shown is that there is no such thing as an honest politics that revolves around the world again. It is time to walk away from the politics of the past and towards something totally different. So that's why I'm here today.\",\n",

      "            \"We love you, Pete.\",\n",
      "            \"The forces changing our country today are tectonic, forces that help to explain what made this current presidency even possible. That's why this time it's not just about winning an election, it's about winning an era. Not just about the next four years, it's about preparing our country for a better life in 2030, in 2040, and in the year 2054 when God willing I get to be the same age as our current President. I take that long view because I have to. I come from that generation that grew up with school shootings as the norm, the generation that produced the bulk of the troops in the post-9/11 conflicts, the generation that is going to be on the business end of climate change for as long as we live. We're a generation that stands to be the first ever in America to come out worse off economically than our parents if we don't do something truly different. This is one of those rare moments in between whole eras in the life of our nation. I was born in another such moment in the early '80s when a half century of new deal liberalism gave way to 40 years of Reagan-style supply-side conservatism that created the terms for how Democrats as well as Republicans made policy, and that era, too, is now over. So if America today feels like a confusing place to live, it's because we're on one of those blank pages in between chapters. Change is coming, you're ready or not. The question of our time is whether families and workers will be defeated by the changes beneath us, or whether we will master them and make them work toward a better every day life for us all. And a moment like that calls for hopeful and audacious voices from communities like ours. And, yes, it calls for a new generation of leadership in this country. The principles that will guide my campaign for president are simple enough to fit on a bumper sticker, freedom, security and democracy. First comes freedom, something our conservative friends have come to think of as their own. But let me tell you, freedom does not belong to just one political party. Freedom has been the Democratic bedrock ever since the new deal, freedom from want, freedom from fear. Our conservative friends care about freedom, but they only make it part of the way. They only see freedom from. Freedom from taxes, freedom from regulation, as though government were the only thing that can make somebody unfree, but it's not true. Your neighbor can make you unfree. Your cable company can make you unfree. Your freedom depends on a lot more than just the size of your government. Healthcare is freedom, because you're not free if you can't start a small business when leaving your job means losing your healthcare. Consumer protection is freedom, because you're not free if you can't sue your credit card company even after they get caught ripping you off. Racial justice is freedom, because you're not free if there's a veil of mistrust between people of color and the officers sworn to keep us safe. Empowering teachers means freedom, because you're not free in your own classroom if your ability to do your job is reduced to a number on a page. Women's equality is freedom, because you're not free in your reproductive health choices are dictated by male politicians. Organized labor sows freedom because you're not free if you can't organize for a fair day's pay for a good day's work. And take it from Chasten and me, you're not free if a county clerk gets to tell you who they ought to marry because of their idea of their political beliefs. The chance to live a life of your choosing in keeping with your values, that is freedom in its richest sense, and we know that good government secures freedom just as much as bad government denies it. Now let's talk about security. The idea that security and patriotism belong to one political party needs to end today. We are here to say that there is a lot more to safety and security than putting up a wall from sea to shining sea. To those in charge of our border policy, I want to make this clear, the greatest nation in the world should have nothing to fear from children fleeing violence and even more importantly -- even more importantly, children fleeing violence ought to have nothing to fear from the greatest country in the world. Security means cyber security. It means election security. It means keeping us safe in the face of violent white nationalism rearing its ugly head around the country. Let's pick our heads up to face what might be the greatest security issue of our time, climate change and climate disruption. No region of our country is immune to that threat. We've seen it in the floods in Nebraska, the tornadoes in Alabama, the hurricane in Puerto Rico and the fires in California. We saw it right here in this city where as mayor we had to fire up the operations center, the emergency operation center of this city twice in two years. First came a thousand-year rainfall and then came a 500-year river flood, 18 months apart. Now by my math, the chance of that happening is about 125,000 to 1. So either we should all be heading down to four wins later to try to recreate those odds on the slots or something is changing around us. And we're not even having a contest over whose climate plan is better because only one side brought forth any plans at all. If you don't like our plans on climate, fine, show us yours. Our economy is on the line. Our future is on the line. Lives are on the line, so let's call this what it is. Climate security, a life and death issue for our generation. And now let's talk about democracy, because no issue we care about from gun safety to immigration, from climate to education to paid family leave. None of it will be handled well unless our democracy is in better shape. Our democratic republic is an elegant system, but lately it hasn't been quite Democratic enough. It's not Democratic enough if legitimate voters are denied the ability to exercise their rights because one side thinks as a matter of political strategy that they're better off if fewer citizens are able to vote. It is hardly democracy if Citizens United means that dollars can drown out the will of the people. It's not much of a Republic if our districts are drawn so that politicians get to choose their voters instead of the other way around. It's nowhere near the democracy that I swore to protect with my life when U.S. citizens from Washington, D.C. to Puerto Rico don't even have the same political representation as the rest of us. And we can't say it's much of a democracy when twice in my lifetime the Electoral College has overruled the American people.\",\n",
      "            \"Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete.\",\n",
      "            \"Why should our vote in Indiana only count once or twice in a century, or your vote in Wyoming or New York? So let's make it easier to register and to vote. Let's make our districts fairer. Let's make our courts less political, our structures more inclusive. And, yes, let's pick our president by counting up all the ballots and giving it to the woman or man who got the most votes. Now, I like talking about systems and structures, philosophies and theories, but nothing about politics is theoretical for me. Someone said all politics is local. I would say all politics is personal. Time and time again moments in my life have forced me to realize what politics really means. I learned it when I went overseas on the orders of a commander in chief. When you write a letter and put it in an envelope marked just in case and set it where your folks can find it, you never again lose sight of the stakes. And by the way, when I was overseas, each one of the 119 trips I took outside the wire driving or guarding a vehicle, we learned what it is to trust fellow Americans with our lives. The men and women, the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines and civilians who got in my vehicle, they didn't care if I was a Democrat or a Republican. They cared if I had selected the route with the fewest IED threats, not whether my father was documented or undocumented when he immigrated here. They cared if my M4 was locked and loaded, not whether I was going home to a girlfriend or a boyfriend. They just wanted to come home safe like I did. They wanted what everyone wants, to do a good job, to live well and to come home. And making sure that kind of thing happens is what politics is for. Politics matters because it hits home. It hits home at our most vulnerable moments, like the day last fall when I left my mother's hospital bedside to go find my dad across town in the middle of his chemotherapy treatment to let him know she was going to need immediate heart surgery, not the kind of thing you put in a text message. So I had to go find him. By the way, mom's fine. She's right over there. Right over there with my amazing in-laws, but that's a different story.\",\n",
      "            \"You did good, mom.\",\n",
      "            \"So that tough day I had a few things going for me as difficult as it was. I had Father Brian who gave the invocation today who lifted us with faith and companionship and I had my husband Chasten. He was right there at the hospital. He stayed there. He was at the hospital where he belonged, because in the eyes of the hospital and the state and the law he was not just someone I loved, he was my lawfully married spouse. Our marriage exists by the grace of a single vote on the U.S. Supreme Court. Nine women and men sat down in a room and took a vote and they brought me the most important freedom in my life. Mom started getting better, right away. Dad started getting worse. We lost him earlier this year. And I watched -- as I watched things change from him caring for her to her caring for him and the two of us trying to take care of the two of them. Once again, we found our lives shaped by the decisions of those with power over us. Decisions that made us better off because some people in Washington made the decision to bring us something called Medicare. So when I think about how we had to navigate those tough family decisions, I think about how fortunate we were that all we had to think about was what was right medically for mom and dad both, not whether our family was going to go bankrupt over this. That's how government touches our lives. It's how policies bring us freedom. And when it comes to health care, I want every American to have that same benefit. This is why Washington matters. Not the political ups and downs, not the daily drama of who looked good on cable in a committee meeting, but the way that a chain of events that begins in one of those stately white buildings reaches into our lives, into our homes, our paychecks, our doctors' offices, our marriages. That is why this country was invented in the first place, and that is what's at stake today. At least, that's how it supposed to work. When something is grotesque, it's hard to look away. And the horror show in Washington is mesmerizing, it's all-consuming. But starting today, we're going to change the channel. Sometimes a dark moment brings out the best in us, helps us find what is good in us. Dare I say, what is great in us. Because I do believe in American greatness, I believe in American values, and I believe that we can guide this country and one another to a better place. After all, running for office is an act of hope. You don't do it unless you think the pulleys and levers of our government can be used and if necessary redesigned to make the life of this nation better for us all. You don't do it unless you believe in the power of a law, a decision, sometimes even just a speech, to make the right kind of difference, to change our lives for the better, to call us to our highest values. Things get better if we make them better. After all, you and I stand now in a building that was a symbol of our city's decline, where new jobs are now being created in industries that didn't even exist when they poured this concrete and laid this brick. You and I now stand in a city that formally incorporated in 1865, the last year of a war that nearly destroyed this country. What an act of hope that must have been? We stand on the shoulders of optimistic women and men, women and men who knew that optimism is not a lack of knowledge, it is a source of courage. And it will take courage to move on from our past. We're not going back. You know, if I did get a chance to go back, it wouldn't be out of a desire to live in that past. If I went into the past, it'd go just twenty years back so I can find that teenage boy in the basement of his parents' brick house, thinking long thoughts as we played the same guitar lick over and over again on his little Stratocaster, wondering how he could belong in this world, wondering if his intellectual curiosity means he'll never fit in, wondering if his last name will be a stumbling block for the rest of his life, wondering what it means when he sometimes feels a certain way about young men he sees in the hall at school, if it means he'll never wear the uniform, never be accepted, never know love. If I found him and told him what was ahead, would he believe me?\",\n",

That he would have a hand in transforming the neighborhoods he knew as a boy, and that he would help the lights come back on in that giant factory whose broken windows loomed like the face of a ghost over the ballpark where his dad used to take him to games, where he wondered if this city was his own. To tell him that he'll be all right, more than all right. To tell him that one rainy April day, before he even turns 40, he'll wake up to headlines about whether he's rising too quickly into becoming a top- tier contender for the American presidency.

Yes, running for office is an act of hope, so is supporting someone running for office. So this afternoon, are you not hopeful? Do we not live in a country that can overcome the bleakness of a challenging and divided moment? Are you ready to turn the page and start a new chapter in the American story? You joined me. If you and I rise together to meet this moment, one day they will write histories, not just about one campaign or one presidency, but about the era that began here today in this building where past, present, and future meet right here this chilly day in South Bend. It's a little cold out, its little cold inside too, but we've had it with winter. You and I have the chance to usher in a new American spring.

And right off the bat, you know, taking direct aim at the White House, calling it a horror show in Washington that is mesmerizing but we are going to change the channel, and promising to tell a very different story than make America great again. Instead, he was very critical saying, you know, returning to a bygone era was never that great to begin with and he is on stage there with his husband, Chasten, making it very clear that all things are possible and that he's ready to make history. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich is also in South Bend where this Democratic mayor has made that special announcement as it was, you know, advertised earlier that he's in the race for the White House, making some, you know, very simple but at the same time very lofty promises about what his campaign is going to be about. And he said he could put the principles right on a bumper sticker, you know, freedom, democracy, security. So, Vanessa, tell me about this crowd there, and how enthusiastic they've bee been.\",\n",

And he talks about the most important freedom, Fredricka, and that was the right to love whomever he wanted and to marry whomever he wanted. He married his husband, Chasten, just last year. He talked about the biggest moment of his life being just that. But, you know, Fredricka, just a month ago, people didn't know who Pete Buttigieg was. He rose to sort of prominence right after the CNN town hall. He's done many, many media interviews on different pod casts, going on \\\"The View.\\\" And he's really made sort of a name for himself in this last month. We have two polls that came out just last week in New Hampshire and Iowa that now put him in third place just behind Biden, who hasn't even announced that he's in the race yet, and Bernie Sanders. Fredricka, it's going to be really interesting to watch whether or not Pete Buttigieg can keep this momentum up. You know, there's a lot of reporters here in town as I'm here in South Bend for a couple days now. You can definitely feel the energy, but the question is we're 18 months away from the election, can he keep this momentum up and will that energy carry across the country and all the way through the debate and into the primary, Fred.\",\n",

And now the field is something like 18, you know, Democratic candidates and he has, you know, raised an impressive $7 million, you know, in a very short amount of time and, you know, ascended in the polls but, what about the level of confidence in his camp about being able to raise more?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, that's right. You know, he came out with that big number, $7 million compared to others, like Booker and Warren, who are more well-known, who have raised less than him. But, you know, his campaign has told me that they're really looking to keep it lean, they're looking to keep that money sort of in the bank. They're not going to be hiring a ton of speech writers or strategists or pollsters. They really want to continue to run this campaign very much like a start-up. They think it's worked for them before, and they -- it worked for them up until now. But, you know, he's going to be hitting the road. He's going to New York for a fundraiser on Monday. He'll then be heading to Iowa and then to New Hampshire. So, we know he's going to be getting out there right away, not wasting anytime and, Fred, really capitalizing on this moment.\",\n",

So, Alexandra, New York Post, you know, wrote that this born and bread American rustbelt Democrat could give the President a real run for his money.

So I think the question for our progressive movement is going to be, is he going to align himself with policy proposals like Medicare for all? He's already talked about a Green New Deal, which is extremely encouraging, but also came out against free college.

So, I think the magic of Mayor Pete today is, you know, not so much as Alexandra talked about sort of in his proposals. And I think, frankly, most of these Democratic candidates are going to be pretty close to each other on their policy proposals. I think the magic in each one of them is the story they have to tell and the hope that they inspire, and the intensity with which their followers will move through a primary process, to the polls, getting people energized and being willing to take on President Trump. And I think he showed today that he has a compelling story, that he's prepared to give it everywhere, talking about your husband in a state like Indiana which is we know elected Mike Pence governor and still discriminate against people for being gay or lesbian is a pretty audacious thing and he does it kind of what gusto. And I think taking a message of fearlessness no matter who you are across this country, whether you are, you know, a recent immigrant, or whether you are a lesbian in Mississippi, or whether you are a working mother in, you know, the South Bronx, barely able to make it. I think that that kind of energy and optimism is his story today. And I think that it was compelling.\",\n",

And, you know, Alice, a candidate, it's about inspiring, you know. And he said, you know, \\\"We live in a moment that compels each of us to act. It's not about winning an election, it's about winning an era.\\\" So he is distinguishing himself by age as well along with all the other things that differentiate himself from the candidates, you know, the field of 18. He is calling upon a distinction between he and the sitting president of the United States, Alice.\",\n",

And Alexandra and Hilary are both right in regards to a lot of these Democratic candidates are very similar in their policies and Pete Buttigieg is light on expanding on his policies, but it's working for him. What he is doing is very smart at this point.

In the RealClearPolitics average, he is just over 3 percent and Joe Biden is at 31 percent. But keep in mind, we are 10 months away from the Iowa caucus. He has a long way to go. And the good thing with him, Mayor Pete, is he is on an upward trajectory. He is doing well. And I think he's doing well to continue to go out there, make his case individually to the people. He has a very good demeanor. He has an ability to connect. I think he is someone that we really certainly need to keep an eye on with regard to moving forward, because he has an inspirational story to tell people.

As you noted, \\\"The Arizona Republic\\\" was the first to report this. They got it from an open records request from the State Department of Health Services. As we understand it the Southwest Key facility that oversees the Hacienda del Sol shelter reported this to local law enforcement as well as federal officials. The Maricopa County Sheriff's office did investigate and at the time decided not to pursue criminal charges. But overnight we got a new statement here from the Maricopa County Sheriff's office. \\\"Based upon the evidence gathered during this thorough investigation, MCSO executive command has made the decision to submit the case to the --\",\n",

The case will be submitted Monday and further questions about this matter should be directed to the county attorney.\\\" We should mention that the Hacienda del Sol shelter has since closed at it was at the time in October when they announced that it was being closed that the Southwest Key spokesman said that he welcomed the decision by the Office of Refugee Resettlement but they wouldn't go into details. Now looking at this surveillance video, we can tell why. It's just another dark stain on the story of migrants here being held in the United States. We should also note that two of those staffers as well as a third was disciplined. Two of them were fired. But this is just really awful, awful news coming out of Arizona.\",\n",

President Trump's surprise decision to pull out of Syria has been widely criticized but that may soon change. Again, Senator Lindsey Graham telling reporters the president has agreed to slow down the withdrawal of troops from the country. Graham says commanders have informed the president that ISIS is still a threat there.\",\n",
      "            \"I think the president has come up with a plan with his generals that makes sense to me. The goal is to make sure ISIS doesn't come back. We left Iraq too soon, we had them on the ropes in Iraq and left too soon. I think the president is very committed to making sure that, when we leave Syria, that ISIS is completely defeated. And we are inside the 10-yard line. And the Iran-Kurd situation has to be dealt with. So I think we are in a pause situation. We're reevaluating what's the best way to achieve the president's objective of having people pay more and do more.\",\n",

      "            \"Well, I think what Mr. Trump did is he did what has served him well a lot of times, which is say I just want to pull troops out of Syria. Now as we know, for the Secretary of Defense, this was just the last straw. He said this goes against the advice of everyone in your administration -- or almost everyone. This goes against the advice of all our allies. And he says I need to work for someone who is a player on the world stage, who is an honest broker. I think what has happened a number of times in the Trump administration and what we're seeing happen with respect to this decision for the Syria troops is that someone said to President Trump, it's not feasible. You can't do it. You cannot just announce that we are pulling troops out. It would be a disaster. And I think that he has now come to the conclusion that, that's right, we cannot pull troops out. And that's why we see surrogates like Lindsey Graham saying, maybe there is another road. And we have seen this with respect to a number of different positions that the president has taken, where he goes out, kind of guns blazing and says we'll take this really aggressive step and then later he pulls it back. And I think that's what we are seeing with Syria, too.\",\n",

Opposition parties are challenging Sunday's election results in Bangladesh.

Officials say her alliance won the majority of seats and she is likely headed for a third straight term. She is accused, however, of human rights abuse and a crackdown on her critics.

This would set her up for a third straight term, her fourth term overall in office as prime minister of the country. The opposition as you point out, has been questioning these results. And this comes really after concerns raised by human rights organizations in the run-up to the poll. Human Rights Watch, ahead of the poll, said there was a climate of fear in the country as her government was accused of cracking down on dissenting voices. But as the results stand today, show that she has won the third straight term. And, you know, in the whole process, throughout the whole process, even as people have raised questions about the credibility of the ballot, there has been this other story that you also touched on, which is the story of the booming economy. You know, Bangladesh has done very well in recent years in cutting down poverty and making progress on a whole host of development indicators --\",\n",

The military was out in force and they were all out in force to stop a repeat of the violence that we have seen in previous polls, where the numbers and fatalities have been much higher. We have seen lower levels of violence so far, but we have to wait and watch because there still remains a fluid situation because, with the opposition questioning the credibility of the ballot, we have to see how this plays out in coming days. Right now, Sheikh Hasina looks like she's won a third straight term. But we'll have to see how the opposition respond. You know, will there be street protests, will there be ground action to challenge this? We'll have to see -- Natalie.\",\n",

      "            \"Interesting discussion there. Breaking news, though: I want to show you Denver International Airport -- on the ground, United Flight 663. The breaking news, we have details, very preliminary. We're being very careful not to get ahead of the facts. What we know is this. There was a disturbance aboard the flight traveling from Reagan National Airport in Washington to Denver International Airport. Someone tried to light their shoe or shoes on fire. The plane is on the ground, as I said, met by authorities in Denver, including the TSA and the FBI. Joining us now on the phone, national security analyst Peter Bergen, also on the phone, Fran Townsend, national security contributor and former White House homeland security adviser. Fran, what do you make of this?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, first thing, Anderson, you know, look, I'm sure what they're trying to figure out here is, is this person crazy? In other words, somebody had a mental breakdown and caused a disturbance on the flight. The concerning fact here is -- is the shoes on fire, because, of course, that's reminiscent of the Richard Reid attempted plane bombing going back -- oh, gosh -- I guess that was 2002. And, so, you know, was this an attempted terrorist attack, like the Christmas Day attempt, using a shoe bomb, or was this just a mental disturbance, you know, a mentally disturbed person? And I'm sure that's what they're sorting through now. Interesting they have got the FBI there and TSA. You know, one of the other questions I have is, what does the National Counterterrorism Center know about this individual? Some preliminary reports suggested it was a diplomat. You know, I guess we're going to have to wait and see what more we can find out about it.\",\n",
      "            \"The other question is, were there air marshals on board this flight? Is that how this person was -- was subdued, if it came to that?\",\n",
      "            \"That's right, Anderson. You know, initial reports suggested there had been air marshals on board that helped subdue this person. But now United Airlines, the spokesperson didn't confirm that, and said that they had asked for law enforcement officials to meet the plane on the ground. And, so, again, conflicting reports early on, that's not really a surprise. I expect they're trying to sort this whole thing out. One good indication to me is, I understand that the airport operations -- that is, you know, incoming and outgoing flights there at the Denver Airport, haven't been affected. And that's a good sign. That means they feel like they have got a real good handle on this.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, this was Flight -- United Flight 663, going from Reagan National in Washington, obviously, to Denver. Peter Bergen, obviously, Peter, leaving from Washington, D.C., I mean, security is always tight, especially at that airport.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, Reagan has, obviously, extreme good security, so this is a big black eye. It appears that there is a shoe bomber involved. So soon after the Christmas Day attempt, you know, speculation on my behalf here, but the guy who built that shoe -- the bomb on Christmas Day, the -- the bomb that didn't go off over Detroit, that bombmaker is still out there. And, clearly, that bombmaker may also have been involved in the Richard Reid attempt that we -- that Fran just mentioned back in 2001, because the -- the bomb ingredient in both of those attacks was PETN. It's a very unusual explosive. There's no indication that that bombmaker has yet been eliminated or captured. And building a shoe bomb is not an easy thing to do. And we may find that it's the same shoe -- the same bombmaker in all these cases, because they bear a certain amount of similarities.\",\n",
      "            \"They all have a similar signature in that -- in that ingredient?\",\n",
      "            \"In that ingredient and either the ankle-length hiking boots that Richard Reid was wearing or the shoe bomb that may be in this case or the secretion in the undergarments in the case of Christmas Day. Anderson, as you know, in this kind of situation, always there's kind of misinformation initially. Going back to Christmas Day, the first -- the first reports were that a firecracker had gone off on Northwest Flight 253. Of course, it was much more serious. So, right now, we have these sort of fragments about the story. But the fact that the FBI is involved, as Fran mentioned, that indicates to me this is not some -- just some guy who is acting out on a plane, that this is something more serious that they're going to be looking at.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. And, as always in these situations, there are a lot of rumors out there and a lot of speculation out there floating around right now. We are not telling you that, because, frankly, we want to be very clear on what we know, what we don't know, and what is just rumor. Again, United Flight 663, the flight is on the ground. Clearly, as you can tell by all the flashing lights around that plane which is at the center of that, it has been met by law enforcement. The flight's crew asked for law enforcement to meet the plane. There was a disturbance on the plane. No one on board apparently was injured, according -- to the best of the spokesperson's knowledge, said -- this spokesperson said they had no details on the nature of the incident. It's a Boeing 757 -- 157 passengers were on board, six crew, the flight leaving from Reagan National to -- to Denver, and one source saying airport operations have not been affected. Again, this flight has been met by the TSA and the FBI. We're going to continue to carefully follow this, bring you any updates as warranted. We will probably have a few more updates coming up a little bit later in this hour. So, again, stay tuned for that. Also tonight, new developments in the effort to make the Upper Big Branch coal mine safe enough for rescuers to try and locate four miners who might -- I say might -- still be alive, though hope is slim. And that new Tiger Woods' ad involving Tiger Woods and his late father. (\",\n",

In a world where low prices lead the way, exactly what makes clothes or food so cheap may be hazardous to our health. So the next time you're cutting coupons, it might be good to remember that what you're buying for cheap now may cost later.\",\n",
      "            \"To talk about the cost of a greener planet, we've got economist and president of Bennett College, Julianne Malveaux.\",\n",

      "            \"I'm good. Yourself?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I am doing great. So, you know, nobody wants to spend a lot of money on the basics. When it comes to the issues of buying groceries, buying things for the home, do people really take into account the environment?\",\n",
      "            \"It depends on where they are on the income stream, Farai. If they have more disposable income, I think that these green issues become more important to them. People talk about them. People look at the long run versus the short run, and even look at some of the health effects in terms of what kind of additives are being added to food and how healthy those things are -chemicals and other things.\",\n",
      "            \"But I think if you're looking at people with very basic incomes, when you raise a question - if you say organically produced chicken costs 50 percent more and you're a single mom, forget about it. If you say that produce that is organic, it's going to be another 20, 30 cents a pound. Even though you may wonder about the additives, you still may say, forget about it. If you can't see the difference and you don't know the difference, and education isn't being done, but even more than that when so-called healthy products are less affordable, those who are fiscally challenged are going to take a pass on them.\",\n",
      "            \"And if you go into a lot of grocery stores especially ones in lower-income neighborhoods or even, you know, some middle class neighborhoods, you don't even have the option of a lot of organic goods.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, that's another issue. I mean, if you look at many inner cities, you don't even have grocery stores. You have the little mom and pops on the corner. So just getting produce - have you ever walked into one of those hood stores where, you know, the ratio of pork rinds to fresh fruit is like 500 to 1?\",\n",
      "            \"So, you know, those aren't even options there. You look at the places like a Whole Foods or Harris Teeters, where are they? They are in the suburbs not in the inner cities often. And even when they are close to inner cities, you know, are they near bus lines or things like that? So, all kinds of issues of accessibility that come along with issues of affordability.\",\n",
      "            \"What there are, though, are people trying to come up with different solutions. One of the things we've covered on NEWS & NOTES are urban farmers markets that try to go into neighborhoods where there's, you know, there's not a lot of money and often, there are people of different ethnicities. Like in L.A. you'll find Latin American and Mexican immigrants along with American-born black folks. And they try to say, okay, let's have a farmers market where we can have the fresh cactus and we can have eggs and we can have things that appeal to different markets. Are things like that making a difference?\",\n",
      "            \"I think they do make a small difference but when you look at those places, the volume and the variety, you know, maybe people are buying them for some supplemental things. They're not going to be the places where people take care of their basic food needs. Increasingly, sometimes they can be. When you look at some of the urban farmers markets and people from surrounding areas who decide that they can get a better deal by selling your apples or their lettuce or, you know, their other produce downtown as opposed through a vendor into a supermarket. You get some increased options. You think about Eastern Market in Washington, D.C. or, you know, downtown San Francisco -so many other places, there are possibilities. There are few and there are options that need to be encouraged.\",\n",
      "            \"Let's move from food to some of the other issues. When it comes to things like oil and gasoline, heating oil, natural gas, cars - is there anything that's going on that might broaden the eco consciousness of the Prius crowd to people who might not have Prius money?\",\n",
      "            \"You know, one of the interesting things about gas and heating oil - all of these things is that they're somewhat subsidized. We're not paying real cost in terms of the damage that these things do to the environment in terms of the long-term cost. Now, I know someone is listening and saying subsidize, give me a break. I mean, after all, when you look at gasoline prices today, they don't look subsidized at all. But compare those prices to prices in other parts of the world. If you go to the Caribbean, if you go to Western Europe, you'll see gasoline prices that are higher than ours because people are allowing for the environmental damage.\",\n",
      "            \"We don't allow for that damage which is why when you have a choice between getting on the subway and jumping in your car, often you jump in your car. You think it's cheaper, it's easier but it's only cheaper because of the subsidy. We have to begin to have conversations about energy efficiency. We have had some. But it frightens me, Farai, to think that the - I think it was 1974, '73, '74, '75 when we had those great lines around corners as people tried to buy gasoline because we were having a gasoline shortage. And at that point, the auto industry pledged that they would do more to make sure we're more energy efficient and that lasted for about a minute. And episodically, we'll see this energy efficiency.\",\n",
      "            \"But by and large, we're still doing that SUV gas-guzzler thing and diesel fuel, which is sometimes more efficient and more energy-conscious, is something that's the majority - the minority, rather, not the majority. So we collectively haven't done the things of incentives, et cetera, to make it - make us more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly. And if that's an issue for all Americans, I think that people at the bottom, again, of the income stream are buying old cars as opposed to new cars because that's what they can afford. Don't care about the issue of efficiency, they just want to get to work.\",\n",
      "            \"What about for people who have money, though? There's plenty of black folks, plenty of urban folks - if I can use that term - who have money. And there was a certain cache, for example I'll bring up the Prius again, when that hybrid cars first came out, Gwyneth Paltrow had a Prius and all these celebrities. I think mainly or almost exclusively white celebrities were buying these cars. Is there a cache to being green in the African-American communities?\",\n",
      "            \"I don't think so. I think you have people like Karl Anthony and others who looked at the issues of environmental justice and talked about how to be green. But I don't think that there's been a widespread movement. I don't think you can point to an African-American celebrity who's made the issue of a green environment their issue. There are so many other issues that we have to deal with but let's be clear. There is such a thing as environmental racism. There are places where we bear the brunt of environmental disrespect such as a way that dumping occurs in places that are very contiguous to intercity neighborhoods. And we should take some lead on this as well. This is not a, quote, \\\"white issue.\\\" It's not a majority issue. It's a human issue to take care of our environment. It's the only planet that we have.\",\n",
      "            \"Whose responsibility is it to address these issues? Should it be government? Should it be each one of us doing what little we can? Should it be private industry?\",\n",
      "            \"What's real - always with issues like this, it's a combination. Certainly, government can set the tone, heighten awareness and even with tax credits and other things, make sure that those people who do the right thing get a tax break for it. But government can't do it alone and increasingly we've seen a reluctance to rely on government for everything, so private industry plays a role.\",\n",
      "            \"Those people who are green manufacturers, I think have the possibility of carving out a niche in the market and at some point, seeing consumer support shift to them so industry has a role. And then all of us do, of course. It's our planet. And one of the things that I find interesting is that some of our schools, elementary and secondary schools, are having conversations with our young people about the environment so that a child, very recently, a little boy about eight told me that I shouldn't drink bottled water because it was ruining the environment. I thought that was really cute. I said, where did you learn that? Learned it at school that the plastics are something that we can't continue to dispose of without having some consequences. So we need to have environmental conversations that say actions have consequences.\",\n",
      "            \"When you think about all the different things that have consequences like having unprotected sex, et cetera, et cetera, sometimes we're not so good at the long-range, big picture. We make decisions on a very ad hoc moment-to-moment basis. That's human nature sometimes. What could - I guess it's a personal choice. How do you process that, Julianne, when you take into account behavior as an economist and how much that affects what people do?\",\n",
      "            \"I think that one of the things we look at is the way that people market decisions and market issues so that they become more popular. Think about the fact that maybe 40 years ago, 30 years ago before the evolution of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, you had people who thought that drinking and driving was just okay. And through a concentrated campaign that started from the grassroots and then got government buy-in, the laws have completely changed. Wonder if someone could combine that kind of grassroots with government supports to get us more environmentally conscious.\",\n",
      "            \"Part of the challenge is that a lot of people don't believe that we have an environmental problem. We got people like Al Gore who've done great work around global warming and other things. And I hope that former Vice President Gore takes the cachet he got from the Nobel Prize and uses it to talk about the environment in more micro ways. But the whole thing is changing people's mindset, which takes a very long time. It takes committed people. It takes concentrated effort. And it does take government and industry buy-in.\",\n",
      "            \"Do you think that things that are very grassroots will make a difference? I'm thinking of a couple of the guests that we've had on. There's Van Jones who started Green Jobs Program in Oakland. There's also Sustainable South Bronx, an organization started by a sister that aims to green the ghetto. Do you think that people when see change on the local level it will make them change?\",\n",
      "            \"Oh, absolutely. If people see differences in the Oakland project, the South Bronx project, they catch on. I mean, one of the great things about activism, as we know it, is that these activists, especially in the Internet age, talk to each other. And as they talk to each other and share their programs and develop best practices and get young people involved, I think the possibility for some contagion around these programs exists. But I think that, again, I don't think that very many people quite get it and I don't think that you have yet the impetus, the move to get this to pick up. There's many aspects when you talk about green in the environment. We've talked about food. We can talk about energy. We can talk about clothing and how clothing is manufactured. We can talk about, you know, solar panels and all of those things.\",\n",
      "            \"There are lots of aspects to it. We're waiting, I think, for a green manifesto. We're waiting for someone to write that book, Farai, or, you know, put together that, you know, 30-second soundbite that really makes people say yes this is something that I really want to buy into. From an economic perspective, the economy follows the cues that people put out there. We don't have a way of capturing what economists call the cost of externalities. So every time someone has a toxic emission, there is no cost directly attributed to that. Of course, all of us live less well because of a toxic environment but no one is charging you for that. And because of that, it's difficult to use economic incentives unless you do the tax thing to get people to change their behavior.\",\n",

      "            \"Thank you so much. We are pushing forward on a battle of the titans: President Obama, former Vice President Cheney. Whom do you trust on Gitmo, terror suspects, and national security? Schoolyard brawls are one thing, but a fight club at a school for the mentally challenged is an outrage. For the first time, we'll talk live with a resident captured in the infamous cell-phone video. Sometimes humanity's worst brings out our best. On a city bus in Seattle, heroes emerge from outrageous brutality. And a southern town synonymous with racial strife elects its first black mayor. You'll meet him live right here in the CNN NEWSROOM. Hello, everyone. I'm Kyra Phillips, live at the CNN world headquarters in Atlanta. You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. Protecting Americans, protecting American values. Competing visions from the man who bears those awesome responsibilities and the man who shared those responsibilities in the Bush administration. You heard them here live back-to-back: speeches by President Obama and former Vice President Cheney on terrorism, torture, liberty, secrecy, and the law. The president spoke at the National Archives, home of the Constitution.\",\n",
      "            \"We are, indeed, at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates. We do need to update our institutions to deal with this threat, but we must do so with an abiding confidence in the rule of law and due process, in checks and balances and accountability. For reasons that I will explain, the decisions that were made over the last eight years established an ad-hoc legal approach for fighting terrorism that was neither effective nor sustainable, a framework that failed to rely on our legal traditions and time-tested institutions, and that failed to use our values as a compass.\",\n",
      "            \"But in the fight against terrorism, there is no middle ground, and half measures keep you half exposed. You cannot keep just some nuclear- armed terrorists out of the United States. You must keep every nuclear-armed terrorist out of the United States. Triangulation is a political strategy, not a national-security strategy. When just a single clue that goes unlearned or one lead that goes unpursued can bring on catastrophe, it's no time for splitting differences.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, helping us cover these weighty speeches, our own CNN's heavy hitters. CNN White House correspondent Ed Henry and, in our D.C. bureau, senior political correspondent Candy Crowley. Well, the venues were different, but the backdrop for these talks was the same. A congressional revolt over Gitmo and flack over memos, photos, tribunals, much of it from Democrats. Ed Henry, the president spoke to all these controversies and freely bashed the Bush administration, but he drew the line on a so- called truth commission. Why?\",\n",
      "            \"Because it fits right into his theme of not re-litigating, as he put it, the last eight years. He wants to move on. We've heard him say before, \\\"Let's look forward, not backward.\\\" The problem, though, of course, for him in part is that some in his own party, mostly liberals, are saying we need to look back to figure out whether laws were broken, and they do want a truth commission. But I think that where this president was finding his voice somewhat in these remarks today was by taking that step back, talking about big themes, trying to, for the most part -- there were some partisan shots -- but for the most part, he was trying to take a step back and say, \\\"Look, it's not black and white here. These are tough decisions.\\\" He vowed that he was going to solve these problems, that he was not going to pass them on to his successor. That could resonate with a good share of the American public, who probably realizes that these are difficult questions. There's no easy answer about what to do with these 240 detainees at Guantanamo. But where the president faces a big challenge, and you mentioned that, on the rest -- on Capitol Hill -- is if that you're going to -- if you're going to say it's gray, it's not black and white, why then on January 22 did this president issue that and sign that executive order saying, \\\"I'm closing it within a year,\\\" without a plan to do it? If it's not black and white, there's certainly -- the critics are now raising questions about whether he moved too fast with that executive order, Kyra.\",\n",
      "            \"All right. Ed Henry at the White House. Ed, thanks so much. Now, for Cheney, seven-plus years of no major attacks since 9/11 speak for themselves, but he still spoke for -- what, Candy Crowley -- 15 pages, and a lot of it sounded pretty personal.\",\n",
      "            \"It did. Listen, and it is personal. I mean, this is not just about Dick Cheney. It is about the history of the Bush administration. And he said in the speech and he's said it before, that he believes that the Obama administration is telling half truths, that they are not telling the other side of the story. For instance, when they went ahead and declassified the memos that showed the justification for torture and what sorts of torture were used, but did not, Dick Cheney says, put out the other half of that, which is what sort of information did they get from those enhanced torture techniques? So it is, first of all, about, he says, telling the whole truth about what happened. And also there's a legacy thing going on there. There's no doubt about that, and what did the Bush administration do. And you mentioned what their chief selling point is, and that is we didn't have another terrorist attack after 9/11. But it is also, the former vice president tells us, as does his family, about what he deeply believes. And he deeply believes that the things that the Bush administration did, that the Obama administration is now undoing, were the things that kept the nation safe. Ergo, he believes the nation is now less safe, and they say he feels very strongly about that.\",\n",

Now, before we move on, know that I'll be talking about national security and American ideals with senior White House advisor David Axelrod. That's minutes from now right here in the CNN NEWSROOM. Well, they wanted to carry out a holy war against America. That's what authorities are saying about four men arrested in New York last night. They allegedly planted what they thought were bombs near two New York City synagogues. Investigators say that they also planned to attack U.S. military plans with surface-to-air missiles. There was a court hearing for three of the suspects just a short time ago. CNN national correspondent Susan Candiotti standing by in White Plains, New York. Susan, you were actually in the hearing. Tell us what happened.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, so far three of the four suspects have appeared before a U.S. magistrate, and each of them waived their right to hear the charges read in open court. They were brought in wearing handcuffs, shackled to their waist, and continued to shake their heads in disbelief, as if to say, \\\"I don't know what you're talking\\\" about as the prosecutor went ahead and read some of the charges. Now, prosecutor Eric Schneider, in fact, said at one point these are men, quote, \\\"who eagerly embrace any opportunity to bring a terrorist operation,\\\" and then went on to say, when speaking of their targets, in this case two Jewish synagogues, the prosecutor said, quote, \\\"They are eager to bring death to Jews.\\\" Now, during the course of this hearing, one of the suspects asked to be -- get some hospital treatment, because he said he was cut by some of the breaking glass that was shattered when authorities broke up the alleged plot last night outside one of the synagogues after the suspects, according to police, had planted explosives there. The next step is a preliminary hearing scheduled for June 5, Kyra.\",\n",

It's made a deal with the UAW to slash its costs and obligations tied to union workers and retirees. We don't know all the details, and the rank and file still has to vote. And GM still has to deal with an even tougher crowd, bondholders, whom it's asking to swap $27 billion in IOUs for only 10 percent of the restructured company. Stay tuned.

Police say they have video evidence of Kraft at a spa targeted by police during a wide-ranging human trafficking investigation. Now the Patriots and the ownership of the sports teams that he's associated with say that Kraft categorically denies the allegations. He categorically denies that he broke any law. Joining me now, Joe Lockhart, former executive vice president of the National Football League, and Michael Smerconish, he's the host of CNN's \\\"SMERCONISH.\\\" Gentleman, I want to put one thing out there. I do not think there -- this is a sports story at all. So my concern about what the NFL does and what the Patriots do here is at a much lower level than what this means for society and what this means in terms of the law. And to that point, Michael, on your show over the weekend, and it got a lot of attention, you called this investigation that wrapped up Bob Kraft, you called it the largest waste of resources since Jussie Smollett. What do you mean?\",\n",
      "            \"What I mean is that -- let me say at the outset, that those who would subject others to human trafficking need to be punished to the full extent of the law. I said that over the weekend. That part seems to have been ignored. I think we should also keep in mind that most of those involved in the commercial sex industry, men and women, are not a part of trafficking and for them I have a libertarian attitude. I don't think it should be our business what goes on between consenting adults. To get to the heart of what you're raising, I don't think this will change anything. I think that Robert Kraft will be embarrassed, but human trafficking will go on. And the best way to rid us of human trafficking is to decriminalize or legalize. Frankly, John, it's much like sanctuary cities. You want those who are the victims of human trafficking to be able to step out of the shadows without fear of being prosecute and make reports against those who have subjected them to that lifestyle.\",\n",
      "            \"So, Michael, are you saying you don't think Bob Kraft should be charged here?\",\n",
      "            \"I think that Bob Kraft has to be charged here because it's the law and it's on the books. Let's not lose sight of the fact, though, it's a misdemeanor. I mean this guy is being held out as public enemy number one for a misdemeanor. And I've -- the person who should be on the front page of the newspapers are whomever subjected women to human trafficking, if that's what took place. He's become the fall guy.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, let me read you a quote from \\\"The New York Times\\\" which did a big investigation into what's been going on in Florida over the weekend. This quote is from Sheriff William D. Snyder from Martin County, Florida. I don't believe they were told -- these are the women -- they were going to work in massage parlors seven days a week, having unprotected sex with up to 1,000 men a year. We saw them eating on hot plates in the back. There were no washing machines. They were sleeping on the massage tables. I would never consider them prostitutes. It was really a rescue operation. The monsters are the men. Joe Lockhart, what's your take on this.\",\n",

If they're in human trafficking for what is a legal activity and they know they won't be prosecuted, they'll make the call.\",\n",
      "            \"Joe.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, I mean, I do think this is less about sports and Robert Kraft than about the serious problem of sex trafficking in the country. Ironically, the biggest sex trafficking day of the year is the Super Bowl and the NFL works with the FBI and authorities to really try to crack down on it. But I don't think we can just give everybody a pass that's involved. You know, I think at some level people know that there's something going on here. And I think if there is a silver lining in this, and if Mr. Kraft has to pay the price for that, it's to bring attention to this, to bring some light to this because this is going on all over the country and it rarely gets attention.\",\n",
      "            \"So you don't think that Robert Kraft -- or it's a high bar to imagine that Robert Kraft went into this place twice thinking that these women were there voluntarily doing whatever it was that they were doing?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes, listen, we don't know. He -- he denies it. But let's -- let's assume, let's take any of the other people there. I think it's very difficult to believe that people thought that this was just, you know, illegal prostitution. And I don't want to, you know, disparage Mr. Kraft because we don't know the facts. What we do know is this is a serious national problem we have. And what they're doing in Florida is the right thing. And it's certainly not a waste of time or a waste of money.\",\n",
      "            \"Very quickly, Joe, will the NFL issue any punishment to Bob Kraft?\",\n",
      "            \"I think they'll let the legal process go through. If Mr. Kraft pleads guilty or is found guilty, I suspect he'll be fined, he might be suspended for a few games. There's some precedent with Mr. Irsay and with the Colts for abusing prescription drugs. I don't expect there to be something more drastic like trying to force him to sell the team.\",\n",

That being said, I think what Nancy Pelosi is looking at on this is, what is this doing for average Americans?

Volume one of the report, which covers the national security issues, lays out information that the campaign was willing to receive foreign assistance, and the president's statements since then indicate he still is. Volume two lays out almost 10 different -- up to 10 different potential acts of obstructive behavior. If this doesn't meet the standard, what's in this report, if this doesn't meet the standard of at least opening an impeachment inquiry, what does that say about future ability for a Congress to hold a president accountable for inappropriate and potentially illegal behavior?\",\n",

But it gives you a window into where President Trump is on all of this. He is saying this is a great day for him. And he has -- to reporters in this gaggle that's ongoing praised the Republicans who led off the Republican side of the question. He called them his warriors. And he's also adding that he is not going to weigh in on whether or not Robert Mueller's performance was good or bad. But he believes that the content of what was revealed today did not move the ball in the Democrats' direction. When this tape comes out, as the president is still talking, I think we're going to see a pretty fiery performance from President Trump. At one point, according to the reporters who are out there, he was asked about whether he was worried that he might be charged with some crimes after leaving office, which Mueller testified today was possible. The president lashed out at that reporter, calling them fake news. So a fiery response from President Trump that we're going to get in just a few minutes, Jake, but from the reports of it, President Trump is feeling pretty good today and feeling like this was not the kind of performance from Robert Mueller that he believes set him back. He thinks it was a good day for him.\",\n",
      "            \"All right, Abby Phillip, thank you so much. And, Elliot, obviously, the president claiming a win. The substance of the hearing would contradict that. You had Robert Mueller, the special counsel, say that the president was not exonerated, that he didn't reach a conclusion on obstruction, both of those contradicting the president, that this was not a witch-hunt, that it was not a hoax, that the Russian -- that the Russians approached team Trump and team Trump welcomed their support, and then repeatedly lied about it.\",\n",
      "            \"Right, no obstruction, no collusion, you don't get two bites at the apple, all of those statements are untrue. No obstruction, no collusion, and the two bites of the apple point isn't true, because Congress is not the same as the Justice Department. It's an independent body, just as Carrie had said, that has an obligation to at least look into allegations of presidential misconduct. And, more importantly, members of Congress -- this is back to the political question with Nancy Pelosi -- it ties into that -- members of Congress don't take an oath to their constituents. It's their obligation to get reelected and to serve them. But their oath is to the Constitution. And if they believe and have found there's been a violation of the Constitution in some way, then they do have some duty to at least open inquiries and look into it. And Robert Mueller, in effect, handed it to them with his response to the OLC guidance. And here's why. By acknowledging that he could not charge the president, but still continuing to gather evidence, that evidence goes nowhere, it serves no purpose if the goal wasn't to hand it off to some other investigative body. Now, that's either a future Justice Department that could prosecute or investigate private citizen Donald Trump or Congress. And so he didn't say it today. He was asked the question, should we -- in not so many words, should we impeach, and he sort of backed away from it. But there's no clearer evidence of the fact that he spent two years handing them evidence than the fact that he was teeing it up for them to take it and run with it, if they so chose.\",\n",
      "            \"But one point, Elliot Williams, you said no collusion was proven to be false, but, actually, I think he meant no exoneration.\",\n",
      "            \"No exoneration.\",\n",
      "            \"No exoneration. But the president does have an argument to make in the sense that Mueller testified and the report states they could not find any prosecutable evidence of conspiracy that the Trump team worked with the Russians. And that was originally what this was all about.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, it was. And that's why I have been saying for a long time that the special counsel's report is but one piece of understanding the bigger picture. One thing that Bob Mueller I think was really clear about today was that he viewed his role solely as a prosecutor. And a prosecutor's job is to determine -- to conduct investigation and determine whether or not criminal charges can be brought. And that was the limits of his role. Prosecutorial function is not necessarily the best way -- sometimes it is, but sometimes it's not a comprehensive way to address a national security threat or a president that is engaging in behavior that's inconsistent with his oath of office. There are other mechanisms to deal with that.\",\n",
      "            \"All right, everyone, stick around. Coming up, how the Trump campaign is hoping to use today's testimony from Robert Mueller. We will be right back.\"\n",

Basically he said that you can't after the fact divorce these people. They didn't ask to be divorced, they engaged in legal marriages, so you can't take it away. But people on the other side say, look, the Constitution of California says marriage is between a man and a woman, people of the same sex simply are not married.\",\n",

The question of what happens to the 16,000 to 18,000 who did get married, that's what's uncertain.\",\n",
      "            \"Roland, it's interesting, when you look at the exit results of who voted for Proposition 8, overwhelmingly, I mean, basically whites, Latinos, more or less split evenly.

      "            \"No it doesn't because African-Americans look at it as a religious issue. In 2004, we saw exit polling data that showed African-Americans are far more against the issue of gay marriage than whites were at I mean at a higher rate. And here's the other thing that jumps out. When you talk about gay marriage -- we're looking at it between a man and a woman, go to Arkansas where they had a measure when it came to gay adoption. That measure among African-Americans was around, according to exit polling, 55 or so who were against that, 45 who were for it. So on the issue of gay adoption, much closer on gay marriage, much wider. Second point, many of them voted straight ticket. And so because of Obama at the top of the ticket, as well, that hurt. And last point, Obama has been quoted as saying he believes marriage is between a man and a woman. Those who were for this proposition used his own voice in Robocalls targeting black voters.\",\n",

Because you know there are a lot of folks who say he did nothing really to try to convince, and particularly African-Americans of California to vote no on Prop 8.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, you know, there was a -- this really deceptive advertising campaign that Roland referred to, came very late in the game and I think at a point where it was hard for the Obama campaign to actually get involved. They did --\",\n",
      "            \"Well, hard -- do you mean politically hard or strategically?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, I think both. I think there was just, you know, they made a calculation that they didn't want the last four days of the campaign for President to be involved with same sex marriage. They were worried about Florida, they were worried about Virginia and North Carolina and other states; they just didn't want that to be a national discussion. And, you know, you could argue all day about whether that was the right choice; that was the choice that they made. I think, you know, the problem was that the other side used it as a really deceptive ad campaign to imply that he was for the proposition. And that ended up swaying some voters we saw from the exit polls that some people decided, you know, over the last two weeks and decided in favor of it.\",\n",
      "            \"Roland, do you think if Obama had thrown his weight more behind this it would have made a difference?\",\n",
      "            \"It could have, but he's in a conundrum, because the reality is you look at those numbers, that's where African-Americans stand. If you look at where they base of the support is that is the conundrum that many black partisans have been in. They support the various measures in terms of many may very well believe in allowing gays to get married, but they recognize that their constituents absolutely are against that. And so we saw early on in the Obama campaign where you had some friction between African-Americans and gays when it came to Donna McClark and on the gospel concert. That was a huge issue. And many of the people who funded this campaign said we don't want him involved. Black voters say, wait a minute, we support this guy.\",\n",
      "            \"Hilary.\",\n",
      "            \"I just think it's a mistake to make this be sort of black versus white voters here. When you look at the actual numbers, 86 percent or 87 percent of Republicans voted for this compared to 36 percent of Democrats. The overall numbers are a lot more white people, white Republicans voted against gay rights than African-Americans did. And so I just think that's sort of a particularly not useful blame game. I think that the real issue here is, where do you go from here? Young people overwhelmingly opposed taking away rights from gays and lesbians and older people overwhelmingly supported it. This is a generational issue that has now become sort of this great divide and it happens at a time when you can still be fired in 30 states in this country just for being gay or lesbian. That's really the key point here. I think that President-elect Obama and the Congress are going to start to focus on those issues where there's a lot more common ground on behalf of gays and lesbians.\",\n",
      "            \"So Jeffrey, legally where does this go? I mean, there's now this suit being filed saying that it's really a revision to the constitution and therefore not an amendment, and therefore it needs to be overturned.\",\n",
      "            \"I think that lawsuit is very much a long shot. Trying to get this overturned is fundamentally a political question. And this will be back. There will be a time, and I think Hilary's right that this is a generational thing. Five years from now, gay right supporters, gay marriage supporters may well put an amendment on the ballot themselves. There're always a lots of amendments on the California ballot. And with greater social acceptance, they may win the next electoral battle. But I think ultimately it's in the political arena, not in the courts where this will be decided.\",\n",

But to apply our own fears and our sense of discomfort, perhaps, on the soldiers that are currently serving I think does an injustice to the soldiers. Why would we assume that our soldiers, who are disciplined, who are capable, who are fighting two wars right now and doing it well, why would we assume that they would act solely based on fear and discomfort and somehow just lose it? I think if you assume that, you are betting against our soldiers, and the highest cost, of course, in all of this is you're forcing some soldiers to have to lie about who they are.\",\n",

You cop to that, right?\",\n",

He's going to take this issue, which we didn't do in '93, Rick. He's going to take it to the field and he's going to ask the soldiers and the families. We should have done that back in '93, and maybe we wouldn't be here today. But I think that that's the wise sort of thing. But I would recommend that the secretary take the product of the working group that we worked on, that was compelling to the U.S. Congress, a Democratic Congress, a Democratic president at the time, and they said, OK, we'll have a ban. If they had done the right sort of thing back then, I think perhaps we'd have a different outcome today.\",\n",

However, if he does that work and it comes out differently, and the politicians muck it up, then that's a different issue, and we need to our congressmen accountable for what they do. You know, that's why when you heard Mr. McCain say today, repeal by fiat, no. What the secretary ought to do is, with objective eyes, blind to, you know, the politics out there, go out and find out the facts, report the facts to Congress, and let them spin it and vote to it.

The president's son-in-law and senior adviser helped build the campaign's data operation, which Kushner has said helped micro-target certain voters in key states that helped win the White House. The FBI is interested in finding out whether Russian spies somehow, either through witting or unwitting help, were able to piggyback on that operation to push negative information about Hillary Clinton through social media in certain parts of the country. Now, investigators are also trying to look at his relationship with Michael Flynn, the president's fired national security adviser. Kushner was in charge of the transition's foreign policy operation, and he had his own meetings with Russians, including the head of a Russian state-owned bank that is under sanctions by the U.S. government. Now, there's no indication at this point that Kushner is the target of any investigation, and there's no allegation of any wrongdoing. Jamie Gorelick, his attorney, says, quote, Mr. Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings. He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry.

And I think he's going to have to explain those in details that perhaps he wasn't.

Two things that came out of this election -- one, it was okay to assault a member of the media, and two, Greg Gianforte got through an election without taking a stance on the House health care bill.

President Trump is receiving some pressure from European allies, even the pope, to stay a member of that treaty, but he is considering whether or not to stay in it. He has not made a decision on that yet. Now, the other sort of backdrop here is the fact that many of our European allies are eyeing Russia wearily right now. We have not heard that tone from president Trump at all since he's been on this trip. In fact, one of his senior advisers said yesterday that the U.S. has no position right now on whether it is going to uphold these sanctions that the Obama administration put into place against Russia, which is a pretty stunning comment. Now, the president is wrapping up what has been a five-nation, nine- day foreign trip, and in what is very unusual, he has not held a press conference, he has not taken questions from the press along the way. His advisers feel this is going swimmingly because he's not had to answer any sticky questions about Russia, about the situation there.

      "            \"Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer was asked today about the allegations and evidence given by Lev Parnas and whether Democrat should call Mr. Parnas as a witness given the opportunity. Senator Schumer said upon these allegations have helps strengthened the push for witnesses and that if allowed to call him as a witness, \\\"it's something we wouldn't rule out.\\\" As you heard a few moments ago, Parnas says he is hoping to get that call.\",\n",
      "            \"If you really look at it, I should be their best witness. I should be their number one witness, because I'm the one that got all the dirt supposedly. Why aren't they calling me to testify? Why do they need Biden? Call me. Ask me what Biden did wrong.\",\n",

      "            \"This time (ph), a Republican is there. Joining me now is Democratic Senator Ed Markey, who's one of the jurors in the impeachment trial, he also sits on the Foreign Relations Committee. I'm wondering what you make of Parnas saying President Trump knew exactly what was going on. He's also -- though he has no direct evidence about the Vice President, he believes Pence would have known as well, as well as Mulvaney and Bolton and others. I'm wondering what you make of what his -- of his allegations?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, he's only saying what Ambassador Sonland said that everyone was in the loop, everyone knew, everyone was completely and totally aware of the fact that the President was withholding $391 million worth of American taxpayer money in order to extort an investigation of the Biden family. So, it's very consistent with everything we've heard up until now. But, we are close now to the source because of the relationship, which Mr. Parnas has with Giuliani, and so we know that he was integral to pulling off this caper. And if he's willing to testify, then that's a powerful corroboration of the central charges against the President of the United States.\",\n",
      "            \"It's important to point out Ukraine's foreign minister says he doesn't trust any word, that's a quote, that Parnas is saying. Parnas is facing, obviously, multiple federal -- criminal charges, there's obviously questions about his credibility, which I asked him about also. But to me, one of the remarkable things about essentially what his position was, there is no doubt he was very close to Giuliani. There's no doubt he was in Ukraine doing this stuff. The fact that he would hold up a phone and Giuliani would speak and say, according to Parnas, say to whoever -- whatever Ukraine official he is meeting with, this guy represents me and represents the President.\",\n",
      "            \"Right. There's no question that Giuliani hired Parnas to be a representative in the Ukraine in order to talk to the Ukraine government about an investigation of the Bidens in return for this money. I don't think there's any question about that. Now, Parnas is someone whose evidence, whose testimony should be questioned, challenged, like any other witness, but he should be a witness. He should have his documents presented to the Senate. This is -- ultimately a trial, is a search for the truth. And this evidence that is being presented is directly relevant to the question of what the President knew and when he knew it, what he told Giuliani or his other officials to try to execute as part of this attempt to extort an investigation of the Bidens out of that government. So from my perspective, Parnas should have all of that information provided to the Senate. He, himself, should be made available so that he can be questioned as well.\",\n",
      "            \"It is also remarkable when you hear from Parnas, every time he talks about what the quid pro quo was, what his message to the Ukrainians was, it's always the same, an announcement of an investigation against the Bidens, not an investigation, itself. Like that didn't matter, whether there was -- in fact, Parnas said to me, you know, you wouldn't want the Ukrainians doing an investigation. It's the last place you would trust to have an actual fair and thorough investigation given the corruption issues in Ukraine. They just wanted the announcement.\",\n",
      "            \"It's clear that at that time that President Trump was paranoid about Joe Biden, that he wanted to discredit, undermine that candidacy. I don't think there's any question about that. The only issue now is whether or not the Senate is going to hear --\",\n",
      "            \"Yes.\",\n",
      "            \"-- from Mick Mulvaney, who was first hand in access to the President, whether or not we're going to hear from John Bolton who called it a drug deal, whether or not the other witnesses at OMB or in the White House who had first hand information are going to be allowed to give that information to the United States Senate and to, ultimately the most important audience, the American people. And Parnas in his information only reinforces the testimony that the House of Representatives heard. This would be on top of all of that testimony.\",\n",
      "            \"Yes.\",\n",
      "            \"That's what a trial is. It's not a grand jury proceeding. That's essentially what happened in the House. This is a real trial and you cannot, as those who are conducting a trial, blind yourself willingly to the information which is now available, an avalanche of information which has now become available since the House voted their impeachment articles so that the American people and the Senate, which is by the way also on trial along with President Trump, to conduct a trial full and fair so that the American people can understand what was being done in their name.\",\n",
      "            \"Senator Markey, appreciate your time. Thank you.\",\n",

      "            \"I want to bring in our chief -- CNN's Chief Legal Analyst and former federal prosecutor Jeffrey Toobin, also CNN Senior Political Analyst and \\\"USA Today\\\" columnist Kirsten Powers. Jeff, what do you think of Parnas as a witness?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, you know, he has this distinctive style. He's very dead pan. He's very low key. And you somehow don't realize how extraordinary story he is telling. I mean, here's this guy, the proprietor of a company called Fraud Guarantee, and he is going to the leadership of the government of Ukraine and saying, unless you announce an investigation of the Biden family, you are not getting the money that Congress has authorized. You're not getting the visit, you know, from the President, and you're not getting an Oval Office visit. And it's true. None of it happened.\",\n",
      "            \"The fact -- also, he's just some guy who shows up in their offices and holds up a phone, according to him, Rudy Giuliani's voice emerges from the phone saying you got to listen to this guy.\",\n",
      "            \"And he is -- and, you know, the story checks out to the extent we can. Obviously, I think Senator Markey said it right, you should test his credibility like anyone else. But does he have a story to tell? He sure\",\n",
      "            \"Kirsten, I'm wondering what do you make of Lev Parnas?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, yes. I mean, I think that it's -- if you take a step back from everything that he's saying, like he has this very calm demeanor, I agree with Jeffrey. I mean, it's a really crazy story, but it is a familiar story. It is something that if you watch the hearings, you know, in the House Judiciary Committee and in intel committee, that's a familiar story. There are other people that were saying a lot of the same kinds of things. So I think the fact that he is saying, you know, this was absolutely, A, the President, you know, was leading this whole effort knew about it. The fact that it was always about 2020, he said to you, that this -- everybody knew that, everybody knew that this was about 2020, again, I think it's pretty consistent with a lot of things that we've already heard. And then you add in this letter that's been released of Giuliani representing to, you know, the president of the Ukraine, you know, I'm here in my personal capacity, which also undermines this idea that a lot of Republicans were saying it was just foreign policy.\",\n",

For example just in the past couple of hours, Hong Kong police have arrested 16 people allegedly for taking part in protests last year. That's according to a police source who adds two of the people arrested are local lawmakers.

They are Ted Wei and Lance, and according to police they are part of a group of some 16 people who were arrested and charged with crimes like unlawful assembly, dishonest use of computer, property damage, perverting course of justice and rioting. They've all been linked to two protests of July of 2019, July 6th and July 21st. The lawmakers are saying that - they're arguing that this is a perversion of justice, one of them saying that he was trying to help mediate on July 6th. This was at the height of the protest movement, the anti-government pro-democracy protests that we saw from months in Hong Kong last year, which have largely been crushed, I would argue, in 2020. And the other lawmaker was actually wounded in July 21st when a group of men in white shirts armed with sticks attacked the pro-democracy demonstrators at a subway station. The opposition accused the police of colluding with that gang armed with the white sticks, charges that the police have denied. Bigger picture here Becky by our account there have been at least 14 elected opposition lawmakers and district councilors who have been arrested in just the last three months. This fits a pattern of a larger crackdown on the organized political opposition here in Hong Kong that just happens to come with Beijing imposing a national security law on the city that critics, including a growing number of foreign governments argue rip up the autonomy that Hong Kong is supposed to have the democratic freedoms that are supposed to be ensured here until the year 2047. Becky?\",\n",

The State Department and the Commerce Department have imposed sanctions and visa restrictions on individuals and on 24 Chinese state-owned enterprises that they accuse of being involved in the island building project and the militarization of those islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. This is just one of a number of flashpoints between Washington and Beijing. They include Hong Kong, for example. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on top officials here in Hong Kong for the alleged removal of democratic rights and the autonomy here on other human rights issues. It's clearly part of a campaign issue for the Trump Administration, but it's also a sign of just these shredding relations between China and the U.S. ironically one area where the two countries are still cooperating is trade. A phase 1 trade agreement agreed upon between Xi Jinping and Trump late last year, that still is moving forward where relations elsewhere, consulates being closed in tit for tat moves are signs of the increasing tension, the likes of which we haven't seen, really, in a generation between the two largest economies.

NFL football officially back, the season kicks off tonight in Denver with a rematch of a playoff thriller, the Broncos versus the Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens. Millions of people are expected to tune in, further solidifying football really as America's new favorite pastime. Football is an industry that makes billions of dollars every year at both the pro and collegiate levels. While professional players can count on fat paychecks to soothe the pain of tired muscles, season ending injuries and soul crushing loses, college athletes can't make a dime off their blood, sweat and tears. Yes, they do often get free rides at the universities, but really that's chump change compared to what the schools and NCAA rake in thanks to their football programs. The debate over paying college athletes is the cover story of the latest issue of \\\"Time\\\" magazine. Joining us now is Sean Gregory, the sports editor of \\\"Time\\\" meaning author of the article. Sean, you know, I've been arguing paying college athletes about it for years, but the argument now seems white hot. Why is that? Is it all about Johnny Manziel?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, he's a big part of it. Everyone's passion about Johnny Manziel before he may or may not have signed autographs for money and once it came out that he may or may not have done that, it just raises to another level. I think why it's also hot now is just the revenue numbers that you see. You see the pattern over the last pick, TV numbers doubling, tripling. Over the next decade it's going to get higher and higher. There's huge demand for college sports. There is a college football playoff now that's going to drive demand. So the revenues keep going up, the cost for the players are staying steady above the scholarship, something's got to give.\",\n",
      "            \"How much money are we talking about here? What are the interesting figures in your article? Would you actually put a dollar figure on how much a college athlete is worth?\",\n",
      "            \"Yes. Now there have been studies on that. It's just the basic math to throw out there. If you took the share of revenues that say the NFL get from their teams and you just split that amongst the college players, if you had a totally professionalized environment, which is aggressive and on the extreme end. You know, at a place like Texas A&M;, if you paid all the 85 players equally, it's about $225,000.\",\n",
      "            \"That's a lot of money.\",\n",

      "            \"There are people who do point out that college students who do play football do get some support in terms of free rides, full scholarships, which is, you know, as a parent who is going to have to pay for college. That's a lot of money. They do make a lot of money. Why isn't that enough?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, it's the option to offer more. I mean, we're not saying every school has to pay their players. We're saying why is there this restraint? Why can't a player who might be worth more than the scholarship, because of all these millions of dollars, why can't he have the option to get more?\",\n",
      "            \"Go out and sign autographs, and sell shirts and the like. Tell me how a pay structure would work because it gets very complicated, very fat. If they were going to pay the male college athletes by law and theory, you would think they have to pay female college athletes also. Do you pay every member of the football team the same amount?\",\n",
      "            \"We propose giving the schools the option. Title Nine, it's tricky. It's a challenge. There's an argument that if you don't pay them, it's a discrimination against women. But you can also make the argument if you just pay the men of football and men's basketball, they bring in the money. Some women might get a salary. You know, the schools can figure it out themselves.\",\n",
      "            \"What about the equality on the team? What about the offensive lineman? He is not going to make as much as Johnny Manziel. Is that going to create friction?\",\n",
      "            \"You know, I don't totally buy that. I mean, you know, in every workplace environment, some people get paid more than others. In the Olympics, for example, where athletes can get sponsorships, Michael Phelp's sponsorship level is a lot different than other swimmers. Team USA seems to do all right. So it's a little -- I don't totally buy the -- it's just going to ruin the locker room environment. There's all kinds of work environments where pay is unequal.\",\n",

There's so many reasons why they could have taken a different approach to Tamir despite the, you know, supposed threat of a gun, despite the 911 call.

We're asking elected prosecutors to work to secure indictments of police officers who they regularly work with to secure indictments on other cases. I think what we need here is what the state of New York just ruled.

Even his assistant prosecutor offered justification for the lack of medical attention that was given to Tamir after the shooting, blaming his younger - blaming his sister who was panicked and screaming, you know, at the fact that her brother had been shot, and supposedly distracted the officer. And the officer who committed the shooting injured his ankle, so he was unable to help. I just - knowing the proximity, having physically stood at the spot, none of those things ring true with me.

Then, suddenly, we got some new information about two hours ago. It's now confirmed that Dick Cheney actually had heart attack. It was his fifth heart attack, mild, we -- we suppose, at this point anyway. His office says it was in fact -- let me correct that -- no supposition here -- it was in fact a mild heart attack. He's still in the hospital. Staff says he's resting comfortably, was admitted to George Washington University Hospital yesterday, when he had chest paints. You know, he's 69 years old. He has had a long history of heart problems, dating back to his late 1930s -- wait -- dating back to the late 30s -- when he was in his late 30s. Pardon me. He had four previous heart attacks and had quadruple bypass surgery as well. By the way, Dr. Sanjay Gupta says all source reports he's heard indicate that the former vice president is not in an emergency situation, not hooked to a breathing machine. He's mobile -- all positive signs. And the source has told our John King that Cheney has been making and receiving calls this afternoon. President George W. Bush and Vice President Joe Biden, friends and former top Cheney aides, are among those who have been calling Cheney to wish him well. All right. We told you yesterday at this time about the terror suspect Najibullah Zazi, pleaded guilty to plotting to blow up subways in New York City. Well, now we know more about why. CNN homeland security correspondent Jeanne Meserve has been all over this story. She is at CNN's security desk in Washington with some new details about this. I was just wondering, Jeanne, what kind of torture did they use on him?\",\n",
      "            \"No torture, but they did have a little pressure to put on. The plea deal itself is actually sealed, and so we can't read it to get these specifics, but a law enforcement source tells me that Zazi's mother and father were both facing the possibility of immigration fraud charges. They weren't facing deportation, but they must have done something like, for instance, lied about immigration status on -- on some sort of official document. They faced the prospect of criminal charges. We're told that that was one of the pressure points. We also know that his dad, Mohammed Wali Zazi, had been charged in connection with his son's case. He had been charged with obstruction of justice for trying to get rid of some of the chemicals with which he was going to make explosives. He was released on bond last week. But, clearly, that was another one of these levers that the government could use to try to win his cooperation. And they did that, Rick.\",\n",

There are people out there, many of them on the right, who say you need to use military tribunals. You don't need to put these suspected terrorists through our criminal justice system. And then there are people who are saying, no, our criminal justice system is darn good at handling this type of thing. And I believe now we have the attorney general, Eric Holder, coming out saying, now, here's another example of how well our criminal justice system can deal with this. What -- what's -- amplify that theme for us, if you would, Jeanne. You look at this every day.\",\n",

Here who was an individual who was arrested, who was charged, and who eventually came around to cooperating with the government. And he made the argument it can work in other cases, too. It's one of the tools that we should have available to us. However, there is pushback today from some members of Congress. Congressman Lamar Smith, who is, for example, from Texas, says, wait a minute. Zazi was an individual who had legal status in this country. He was arrested in this country. The criminal courts were appropriate for him. But if you look at someone like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was arrested overseas, who is not a U.S. citizen, he should be tried in a military commission. A couple of other members of Congress also weighing in, Senators Lieberman and Collins saying today that they want to take the $200 million that President Obama had in his budget for security at terrorism trials, take that money and give it to the Coast Guard, which otherwise was going to be facing some cuts. And Lieberman and Collins are saying, we want to do that, because we believe the military commissions are the place to do it.\",\n",

Is he -- are we getting information from him, as well as just getting a -- a -- a guilty plea?\",\n",

As to what he's telling them, nobody is telling us what that might be, but there are a lot of things he might reflect on. Obviously, he can talk about any co-conspirators here in the United States. Also, you will remember, this is the guy that went to Pakistan to get training at an al Qaeda camp. And, so, it's quite possible that he could open up some avenues for the intelligence agencies overseas for them to pursue.\",\n",

The urgent need for humanitarian aid is being met with pledges from around. And visiting French president is promising aid that will go directly to those in need. And later, why the U.S. president is using an executive order to target a pair of China-based social media apps. Nearly a dozen countries have promised humanitarian aid to Lebanon following Tuesday's horrific mega explosion at Beirut's port. A water filled crater marks where a warehouse full of ammonium nitrate blew up, only the port's badly damaged grain silos still standing. You can see it there. The blast killed at least 137 people and injured 5,000 others and many are still missing. Now, the shock over the widespread destruction has given way to growing anger toward the Lebanese government. Documents show officials were warned repeatedly about the hazardous stockpile, confiscated from a Russian owned cargo ship in 2013, but they never got rid of it. Some people are not waiting for their government to help them. An army of ordinary citizens from other parts of the country have taken it upon themselves to begin cleaning up the mountains of debris. An amazing, undertaking there.

So, let's bring in CNN's Nic Robertson who joins us from London with the latest. Nic, thanks so much for being here. There is so much anger out there, people furious with officials who they blame for this. What's the latest on the investigation?\",\n",

And intelligence officials told me some of the first people who were arrested, port -- port workers that were arrested were relatively low level. And what's striking about these latest details on arrest, now it's 16 people. They include the former customs chief and the current customs chief. And why that seems a little surprising is we know that these senior customs officers had been writing to the justice ministry on six occasions in one case, six occasions saying that they were concerned about the safety of the ammonium nitrate in the warehouse at the port. So, these people have been arrested, when the evidence prior to this seem to be that they were sort of whistleblowers on how bad and how dangerous their situation was is slightly surprising. However, it does perhaps appear by the fact their bank accounts have been frozen that authorities don't want them leaving the country, don't want them taking money out of those accounts and perhaps that says the government has reason to investigate the sources of their income. We don't know. But other details that are emerging are that it wasn't only these port officials that had written to authorities in Beirut, saying they were worried about the ships. The ships owners in the summer of 2014, that's almost a year after they've been impounded there at the dock -- had written to the transport ministry and through the port authority saying that they were worried about the safety of the ship, they felt that the cargo is dangerous, and also the ship was not in good condition. It could -- it could sink. The justice ministry, or rather, somebody at the transport ministry, which is where the letter went to with the -- from -- which is where the letter went to, wrote back to the ships owners and said, yes, we are contacting the justice ministry, we are contacting the naval authorities we. So, they've been in this sort of tangled, sort of bureaucracy, if you will, a passing backwards and forwards of the buck, and now to the people who seem to be whistleblowers have been arrested.\",\n",

In the Maroun Maronite Church, the priest conducts a live streamed mass, cut short by the tremor and then the crash of shattering glass. Father Marwan Mawoud (Ph) was sitting in the pews, and immediately assumed it was a political assassination in the streets outside. \\\"God save us, God save us,\\\" he recalls. \\\"We wanted to get out of here with the least the least possible damage.\\\" Glass shards tore into the pews, mostly empty Tuesday evening because of coronavirus restrictions. Two stained glass panels were spared, one depicting Jesus, the other Mar Charbel, a Lebanese saint renowned for miracles. Not a miracle, but perhaps a glimmer of hope that Lebanon's spirit is far from broken is on vivid display in the crowded streets of Mar Mikhael, the neighborhood next to the port. Social distancing has been sacrificed in the effort to cling to a spirit of community in a land where the very system of government is based upon divisions between the countries 18 officially recognized religious sects. Their work done for the day, an ad hoc volunteer crew heads home, singing a popular song with the refrain 'Lebanon will come back.' The city is bruised, bleeding, and battered, but unbowed. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Beirut.\",\n",
      "            \"Among the Lebanese people, the explosion has pushed their frustration with their government to a boiling point. Late Thursday, groups of demonstrators gathered outside parliament in central Beirut, some set fires or threw rocks at security personnel who used tear gas to keep them back. And earlier in the day, an angry crowd heckled Lebanon's justice minister, throwing water and water bottles. Newly-released documents suggest the ministry of justice was one of several government agencies that knew about the ammonium nitrate at the Beirut's port but took no action we. Joining me now from Beirut, Sara El-Yafi is a public policy consultant and political commentator. Thank you so much for joining us. You know, we saw the fury there. People are heckling the justice minister. Explain for us, if you wouldn't mind, why you and so many others are so angry?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, for one, the impact of this explosion is far more devastating than one can even imagine we. Let's not forget that Lebanon has been very much tried on the terrorism and the, on safety front. We are not, at all, foreigners to the idea that we want to be -- that we live in a very volatile country, and that a lot of people benefit from murdering the Lebanese citizens. Politically speaking, because so many different foreign actors have so many vested strategic interests in the country, but this one is not like the booby trap cars that killed many Lebanese people or the political assassinations, or the war. This explosion has far more devastating effects, and not only in terms of the number of casualties, the wounded, and the destruction of the infrastructure, but it would regard also to the disappearance of architectural heritage of the capital. The destruction of the already fragile infrastructure and also -- and also for adding to the already highest pollution per capita in the region, especially -- and especially in disintegrating the social fabric that is already been weaken by 30 years of the most awful and disgusting corruption that anybody in the world could ever witnessed in contemporary history. I think we've made -- we've hit records with the type of corruption that we have. Not to mention the unparalleled economic and financial crisis that we have been going through, which also is unprecedented in a contemporary sense because it's a very multidimensional crisis. All of this to come and be topped with 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate exploding in the middle of most densely populated region of the country, because of sheer incompetence and negligence of the class, of the political class. It makes one want to maybe even wish that it would all -- the entire city would be raised to the ground, if that would mean that the political parties, all of them, would be -- would disappear from the face of this country. People -- people are experiencing a type of emotion that is very new because it is not just helplessness. Because helplessness occurs when you are a victim of a natural disaster. This is a disaster that could and should have been avoided by all means.\",\n",
      "            \"I can hear the emotion in your voice, I mean, clearly this is, you know, this is affecting you and many other people. You, yourself, have been part of the demonstrations. Do you see that anger leading to something? Will this be a tipping point, do you think?\",\n",
      "            \"You know, Lebanon today is ruled by a mafia and a militia. The mafia gives legal cover to the militia, and the militia gives military cover to the mafia. Hezbollah allows the mafia to steal and rob the Lebanese, in return the mafia allows Hezbollah to continue to rule the country militarily and to apply in Lebanon the policy of the Islamist Republic of Iran in Lebanon. All under the auspices that is supposedly protecting Lebanon from any potential Israeli enmity. Israel, no matter what, is -- is -- has been very free over the past few decades to do whatever they want in the country. There is a regular Israeli aircraft flying over the country. We don't see that not happening. Israel might be behind the -- behind the explosion, very well, that is much a plausible explanation. It could have been an Israeli attack. I don't see that -- I don't see Hezbollah or anybody in Lebanon deterring the Israelis from keeping their enmity ongoing. So, the storing --\",\n",

      "            \"-- that Israelis are behind this.\",\n",
      "            \"Of course, there is no evidence that points in any direction, but it doesn't mean it's not plausible. But what I'm saying is even if that were plausible, I don't see the mafia and the militia protecting us from that, is what I'm saying. I'm not saying -- I'm not holding Israel responsible for this, I'm holding our -- our political class responsible for this. I am holding -- I am holding this completely vented and sold and cowardly political class responsible for this because all political parties are involved. The head of the port, Hassan Koraytem belongs to (Inaudible) party, and he answers to the public works minister who's from the Marada Party, and before from the PSP Party. The head of the customs, Badri Daher who belong to the Free Patriotic Movement, which is the party of the president of the republic, answers to the finance minister, who is from the Amal Movement, Ali Hassan Khalil. They all answer to the prime minister who happens to be -- prior, who is today Hassan Diab, before it's Saad Hariri. Before that it was Tammam Salam, before that it was Najib Mikati. They are all -- all responsible, not to mention the former president of the republic. Their -- the starting point is to initiate an independent international investigation. Yes, was it an Israeli attacker, not sure, but more than that, the names and faces of the Lebanese political responsible should be known and tried in an international court of justice, and there is no other way out of this.\",\n",
      "            \"All right. Well, listen, thank you so much, we've run out of time, but we appreciate your -- your views on this. Sara El-Yafi, we appreciate it. And we should just reiterate that Israel has denied any responsibility in this. Well, French President Emmanuel Macron travel to the badly damaged capital on Thursday to see the devastation firsthand. Now, he's the first international leader to do so. Mr. Macron promised to organized more aid from European countries, but he acknowledged the anger of the people having the chronic corruption in the Lebanese government (Inaudible). So, let's dig deeper into the French president's Beirut visit. And for that we go live to London where we find CNN's Isa Soares. So, we heard during the French president's visit. You know, Lebanese people literally pleading with the president saying don't give money to our government. There seems very little trust that public officials will handle the money wisely and honestly.\",\n",
      "            \"Good morning, Kim. Indeed, and you saw some of that anger and some of that revolt on the streets of Beirut yesterday, as you pointed out there. French President Emmanuel Macron being the first international leader to visit Beirut since that explosion. And you saw the anger as he met some of the local residents there. He did see many people working and searching for rubble there, but he also met some local residents. Some local residents as they hug him, as they thanked him that same breath, they were actually blasting the government, calling for a revolution, and that's because what Lebanon is seeing, is years of corruption and mismanagement. I know you are talking to your previous guest about this, and so this, what has really brought Lebanon to its knees is exactly this. It's the corruption, it's the mismanagement. And the explosion at the port, which is such an important artery for Lebanon in terms of imports, was really depute the grass. And so, what the question now remains, Kim, is how exactly does Lebanon want to rebuild? How does it want to start a fresh? French President Emmanuel Macron said it was important for Lebanon to get together and politically, he called for political change. A new chapter, a new era he called it. Take a listen.\",\n",
      "            \"Over and above the explosion, we know that the crisis here is a serious one. And that it places a historic responsibility on the leaders. It is a political, moral, economic, and financial crisis. The first victim of which, is the Lebanese people. It requires extremely quick reactions. So, for me, this visit is also an opportunity for frank dialog, a demanding one, with political leaders and Lebanese institutions.\",\n",
      "            \"So, an opportunity to have a frank and open dialog, but also, this could be a catalyst for political change. And I think that's perhaps one of the main purposes of Macron's visit, Kim. But what he said was that the country many times, you know, more than several occasions yesterday as he spoke to some of the politicians, that he spoke to the media, he spoke to local residents, is that the country will continue to sink, where his words, if reforms are not taken. If anti-corruption reforms do not go through. His message was also for residents there, basically, saying that any money that is put together, that's brought together for Lebanon will not be given out to the elite. So, no blank checks, was what he was promising, Kim.\",\n",
      "            \"So, that's what, you know, many people in Lebanon have been urging. The international community to basically bypass the government and deal directly with citizens. I mean, how might that actually happen? What would that look like?\",\n",
      "            \"And I think Emmanuel Macron already knew that this would be a huge concern for many of the western donors, who have for years been warning that reforms were needed. Anti-corruption reforms were needed in the country. And so maybe somewhat apprehensive about donating to Lebanon at this time, given concerns that the money might not go to those who need it most. So what President Emmanuel Macron is promising, he said, is transparency. A transparent governance. What does that mean? Well, he said that the money being put together led by an international aid conference, that he is setting up, will be transparent, and that means that the money will be going through, be channeled through to not to the politicians, not to the ruling elite who have been blamed for the corruption and the lack of government in the country. But instead, it will go right to the people who need it most. To NGO, to aid charities, to those who have been left homeless. How is that done according to Macron? Well, he said it will be channel through to from big groups, allege groups with the United Nations, as well as the World Bank. They will be able to identify who exactly needs it most. So, I think anyone donating to Lebanon, according to Macron, should rest assured at least that the money is not going to go into corrupt hands. So far, $39 million have been offered, at least from the European Commission site. European Commission promising more, the United States is helping -- hoping to step in as well. So, we've seen a lot of condolences and aid pouring in from around the world. But that message from Emmanuel Macron yesterday of transparency when it comes to aid was critical. Also, important to point out here, that putting the politics aside, Kim, there are 300 million people have been left homeless. So while people are worried about the political side, while they're worried about where the money will be channel through, let's not forget that the state of Lebanon, the country is in economically, and now, how many people will face no home, nowhere to live, so many families left with not a roof over their head, Kim.\",\n",

      "            \"All right. Take a look at some security video we're going to show you here. These are from security cameras inside a casino in Lima, Peru. That's Joran van der Sloot sitting at the table. See him right there? And that's Stephany Flores walking up to him and shaking his hand. See that? All right. Watch as she walks around, looks around, then slowly works her way into a seat at the table. This is the moment the two met, just hours before the young woman was beaten to death in Van der Sloot's hotel room. Right now, Van der Sloot is sitting in a jail at the prosecutor's office in Lima, waiting for formal charges to be filed against him and for them to decide which jail they're going to put him in, because apparently his attorneys want to put sure he's put in a \\\"safe\\\" jail. Jean Casarez is a correspondent for \\\"In Session\\\" on truTV. She's good enough to join us now. Jean, I understand you've talked to Sloot's lawyers today. They're hoping to get the confession thrown out. Is that because they really have a reasonable chance of doing so, or simply because they're lawyers and every lawyer would want the confession thrown out? Of course they would.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, when we talked to them today, it appeared as though they definitely think they have a chance. Now, whether they do or not probably remains in the hands of a judge here in Peru. But they're saying that when Joran van der Sloot underwent this interrogation that lasted days, and even hours, that he did have an attorney by his side, but it was a public defender, somebody they told us that was a buddy of the police. And although he is there to enforce rights, he is not really there to enforce the personal rights of Joran van der Sloot. In addition to that, he told us that Joran van der Sloot didn't want him there and didn't agree to having him there. And that may be a key to their case. They also say they believe that some of the evidence collected at the scene has been tainted. That is very common with the attorneys, but I think we're going to see it here with this case in Lima, Peru. And the only question at this point, Rick, is when are formal charges going to be filed? Because this case is now in the hands of prosecutors. They have that criminal investigation that has been worked on all week by Peruvian national police. They are looking at it. And we believe formal charges will come soon, we just don't know exactly when.\",\n",
      "            \"Here's a question for you. And I know it's somewhat rhetorical, but nonetheless, I mean, I'm thinking as people at home are probably thinking, since he was the last one seen walking in and the last one seen walking out, and she didn't leave the room after that, if he didn't do it, what could his lawyers possibly say -- who could his lawyers possibly say then did it?\",\n",
      "            \"Well, normally an attorney would say that someone else could have come in, in the two days. But we were able to confirm with Peruvian authorities, Rick, that they went through the entire surveillance videotape of that hallway, and they said nobody else entered that room. So that's going to make a difference. And, you know, Rick, in the United States, we usually don't have surveillance cameras in hallways, but they sure did at this hotel. And that's something that is going to make it much simpler for prosecutors.\",\n",
      "            \"Down to 40 seconds, but that means it would be a slam- dunk with or without the confession, then, right?\",\n",
      "            \"But according to his attorney, Maximo Alonso Altez Navarro, he is going to mount a fight. He told us today that, \\\"We're going to trial. This is not a case where we are going to confess. We are going forward.\\\" So I do think there's going to be a battle between the attorneys, and it will come in that trial.\",\n",
      "            \"Well, given what we know so far, good luck to him. It certainly looks like the odds are against him. Good stuff covering this story, Jean, since you've been there for us, and for \\\"In Session\\\" on tru\",\n",

      "ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR : There goes Bill Carter running off set. Just a little behind the scenes for you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome back to NEW DAY. President-elect Donald Trump backing off some of his most extreme campaign promises in his new interview with \"New York Times.\" Mr. Trump ditching his threat to jail Hillary Clinton and shifting his view on waterboarding and climate change.\n",
      "CUOMO : A big question for you and for Trump voters in general will be, \"Do you care that he's changing about this?\" Something else we heard from the president-elect is that he denounced hate group. He addressed potential conflicts of interest. This as we're just learning about a new top pick for the Trump administration. We could get more cabinet picks today. We've got all these different angles covered. Let's begin with CNN's Sara Murray -- Sara.\n",
      "SARA MURRAY, CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well, good morning, Chris. Whether it is climate change, whether it's torture or whether it's the possibility of throwing Hillary Clinton in jail, Donald Trump is making it clear that, on some of his core campaign promises, his views are actually flexible.\n",
      "MURRAY (voice-over) : President-elect Donald Trump now suggesting he won't push for Hillary Clinton to be prosecuted over her private e- mail server or dealings within the Clinton Foundation. In an interview with \"The New York Times,\" Trump saying, \"I don't want to hurt the Clintons. I really don't. She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways.\" And while it may be up to Trump's Justice Department to make the final call on the matter, the tone is a sharp departure from the one he struck on the trail.\n",
      "DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES : She deleted the e-mails. She has to go to jail. If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation.\n",
      "MURRAY : Trump also hinting he has changed his mind on waterboarding and now says he might not abandon the International Climate Accord, saying he has an open mind to it. Trump trying to brush off repeated questions about how he'll ensure his actions as president won't benefit his businesses, saying, \"In theory, I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly. There's never been a case like this.\" Refusing to concede that he should sell his businesses and adding, \"The law is totally on my side. The president can't have a conflict of interest.\" Trump reiterating that he will step back, leaving the Trump Organization for his children to run.\n",
      "TRUMP : I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it. But is that a blind trust? I don't know.\n",
      "MURRAY : But that, too, poses a problem, since his daughter, Ivanka, has already been part of the meetings with foreign officials since her father became president-elect. Trump complaining, \"If it were up to some people, I would never, ever see my daughter, Ivanka, again.\" And making the case for his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to have a role in his administration, maybe as a special envoy to the Mideast. Trump boasting, \"I would love to be the one who made peace with Israel and the Palestinians. That would be such a great achievement.\" Trump also trying to distance himself from the support of neo-Nazis after this video surfaced of white supremacists cheering him on with Nazi salutes, just blocks from the White House.\n",
      "RICHARD SPENCER, NATIONAL POLICY INSTITUTE : Hail Trump. Hail our people. Hail victory.\n",
      "MURRAY : Trump denouncing the group, saying, \"Of course, I disavow and condemn them. It's not a group I want to energize. And if they are energized, I want to look into it and find out why.\"\n",
      "MURRAY : Now, breaking news of yet another cabinet pick for Donald Trump. Sources are confirming to CNN that he will name South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Of course, this is notable, because Nikki Haley was very critical of Donald Trump in the past, but he's also been catching a little bit of flak for mostly naming older white men to serve in some of these senior-level positions, so she brings a little bit more diversity. Obviously, she's a woman, but she's also the daughter of two immigrants who came here from India. Back to you guys.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : OK, Sara. Thank you so much. Let's bring in a member of Donald Trump's presidential transition team. We have hedge fund executive Anthony Scaramucci. Anthony, great to have you here.\n",
      "ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM MEMBER : Alisyn, thank you. Good morning. Happy Thanksgiving.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : And to you, as well. And to your Italian family and your mom who watches us every morning.\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : My mom is crushing on Chris. But don't tell him that. I don't want to feed his ego.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : Don't mention that. Let's talk about the big news that Sara just announced, and that is Governor Nikki Haley becoming U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Why was she the right pick?\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : Well, I mean, I don't want to speak for Mr. Trump because, really, he would be the best person to say why she's the right pick. I can talk about her personally. I mean, I love her. She's been a phenomenal Republican, great executive. She has the diplomatic skills to handle this. I think you saw her in the crisis during that -- the gun situation in the church, maybe 18, 24 months ago. She is a person that has an enormous amount of respect across parties.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : Yes.\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : And so my guess is she'll do a phenomenal job there. And this is a big message, I think, to people about the transition, is that Mr. Trump wants to reach out to everybody whether they were with them or not with them prior to the campaign. I think he would say, if he was sitting here, that whatever was said prior is sort of over. We have to come together as a nation. We have to come together as a party, and he also wants to bring a very diverse group of people to Washington. And obviously, she'll be in New York, but on his team.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : That is interesting, because she was critical of him during the campaign. How did he get past that? I mean, we often see Donald Trump as someone who does remember the critical things that people said about him and doesn't let those go so easily. So how did he get past it?\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : I see a different side of him, probably because I spent so much time with him over the last six months. You know, my grandfather would say this: You have to be a good sport in life. You've heard that expression. And so Mr. Trump, the president-elect is definitely a good sport. His attitude is, it's a hard-scrabble environment. Governor Haley is probably loyal to factions in the Bush or the Rubio campaign...\n",
      "CAMEROTA : Yes.\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : ... or Cruz at that time. And you have to remember she had long ties to them. Mr. Trump is 18 months into his political career and, so, I think he would look at this and say, \"Listen, these people are loyal to each other.\" He respects that. He respects that loyalty.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : Yes.\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : But now that he's the president-elect, he would like to bring those people in. It's sort of that sort of team of rivals concept that President Obama employed...\n",
      "CAMEROTA : President Lincoln.\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : President Lincoln.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : We've heard that there might be other big news. Can you break some news here on what other announcements will be happening today?\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : You know, that's really not for me to do.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : You are here for Mr. Trump.\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : I am here for Mr. Trump, but I will tell you that I think -- I don't like stealing people's thunder. At the end of the day, I think I'm on the team, because I understand the concept of team. And you remember this, probably, from high school. Together everyone achieves more. So it's Mr. Trump's voice that we have to hear from.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : Will there be an announcement today of some kind?\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : You know, my guess is there probably won't be. My guess is that there will probably be more announcements next week. I think this will probably be the announcement for today.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : Secretary of state...\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : Yes.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : ... where is it right now in the negotiations? Is it leaning Mitt Romney? Is it leaning Rudy Giuliani? Is there another name we should know about?\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : Well, listen, I mean, I think that -- I think, again, this is a president-elect decision, but I think he loves both these guys for different reasons. And he's willing to put aside whatever the things that Governor Romney said during the campaign. One thing that I think your viewers and you should really focus on as it relates to the State Department, we see a lot of problems in there. You know, the $6 billion that went missing. The person that gets dropped into the State Department, he or she, is going to be somebody that the president-elect really thinks they can really fix the department and figure out what went wrong there. So the restructuring aspect of both a Rudy Giuliani and a Governor Mitt Romney would be good things to look at in terms of their skill set.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : Here's one person who does not think that Mitt Romney would not be a good choice, and that is former speaker Newt Gingrich.\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : I'm not surprised.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : I have it for you. Let me play it.\n",
      "NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE : I would be concerned, one, I think the vast majority of Trump supporters will initially be very unhappy and will be reminded of all the things that Romney said over the years. Two, because Romney does represent a very different viewpoint. I can think of 20 other people who would be more naturally compatible with the Trump vision of foreign policy.\n",
      "UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Right.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : What does Speaker Gingrich know that you and Mr. Trump don't?\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : I love the speaker, and he was incredibly impactful during the campaign. But I think that the message to the executive committee on the transition team, which I happen to be a member of from the president-elect is that we need to bring A-plus, plus players into the -- into the game. And, so, I think we need to put aside our differences. The first thing we need to serve is the American people and the second thing we need to do is surround the president-elect with people that he can trust to execute that job on behalf of the American people. So there will be some soreness, whoever is named. There's pluses and minuses to everybody else.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : Ben Carson, has he been offered HUD secretary?\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : I have to take him at his word. He said that he has been offered the job, so my guess...\n",
      "CAMEROTA : Wouldn't you know that?\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : But I would take him at his word. Here's the problem, because I'm here to talk about the concepts, and I'm here to talk about what we're trying to do as a team. But I don't think it's fair for me to steal the thunder of Mr. Trump. And I'll tell you why. One of the most exciting things. Think about early decision in college. OK? If you knew before your kid, you still want your kid to find out on the Internet. And so for me, I sort of feel like I don't want to steal any thunder.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : I'm just looking for a confirmation.\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : Yes.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : So has he -- you're saying take Ben Carson at his word. He has been offered.\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : Absolutely. Ben Carson is an incredibly honest guy.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : OK. But I mean, this is the same person who just last week we heard his top adviser, Armstrong Williams, say that he's never -- Mr. Carson, Dr. Carson has never run an agency.\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : Yes.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : That's a lot to ask. He's a neophyte, and that's not his strength.\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : You know, look, here's what happens when you get people that are not typical politicians. They don't have the verbal dexterity or the verbal acuity of what CNN is used to or other news outlets.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : Sure, but is this a slip of the tongue, or does he really not have the experience to run an agency? Is this truth telling?\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : Let me -- let me put it to you this way. We're probably going to have people who don't have governmental experience in that cabinet but that are very, very effective at what they do. It would probably take me 25 or 30 years to learn how to be a brain surgeon, but I don't think it's going to take that long to be a HUD secretary. Now, maybe I'm wrong about that. But my guess is, is that he's got the right social skills. He loves the country. And he understands the issues that we need to tackle right now in the country. And so I love the guy. I think he's terrific. But he's not a politician. I think that's the big message we have to send to people, that we're going to be putting nonpoliticians in these jobs to help disrupt the system a little bit and possibly make the system a lot better, Alisyn.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : OK. Very interesting. Thanks so much for sharing the process with us.\n",
      "SCARAMUCCI : A pleasure. Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : Have a great one. Let's get over to Chris.\n",
      "CUOMO : All right. Thank you very much, Alisyn. New details about the suspected killer of a San Antonio police officer. Court records show the man on your screen, 31-year-old Otis McCain got married on Monday before he was captured for allegedly shooting and killing Detective Benjamin Marconi. He was arrested six and a half hours later. McCain told reporters he was sorry for Marconi, and he said that he was lashing out in anger at the wrong person, because society wasn't allowing him to see his son.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : President Obama reducing the prison sentences of 79 more inmates. The total number of commutations this week hitting 1,000, more than the previous 11 presidential administrations combined. The White House says the president will grant more before he leaves office. Mr. Obama has said he wants to bring the existing sentences in line with today's laws, which are not as harsh for nonviolent drug offenders.\n",
      "CUOMO : An Idaho man is now out of the hospital after he was struck by a car and fell 50 feet into a river. His name is Steven Arrowsmith, and he had stopped to help another driver on an icy bridge when he was hit. The 34-year-old's leg was badly broken, but he still managed to swim through frigid waters to an island where he was finally rescued. Steven is going to join us live in our next hour to tell us about how he made it through and the image that was in his head the whole time that kept him going.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : He'll be on in our 8 p.m. hour, and he does talk about the one thing that he thought about that allowed him to swim through all that cold water. My gosh!\n",
      "CUOMO : Talk about being thankful on Thanksgiving. He is at the top of the list.\n",
      "CAMEROTA : All right. We'll talk to him. Meanwhile, a stunning admission of wrongdoing by the Trump Foundation. It was detailed in a \"Washington Post\" report. We're going to talk to the journalist who broke this story. That's next.\n"

Late word tonight that Japan's Nuclear Safety Agency has found even higher radiation spikes in seawater near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Now, radioactive iodine levels, more than 4,000 times the regulatory limit in the sea near the plant. Last night, you may remember, those levels were more than 3,000 times the regulatory level. This followed some troubling news from the International Automatic Energy Agency that today, it found elevated radiation levels in a town 25 miles from the plant, which is <WELL> outside the current evacuation zone. So today, TEPCO's chairman said the company has no choice but to decommission four of the crippled plant's six reactors. He's taken over the fight to bring the crisis under control, because TEPCO's president is back in the hospital once again, said to be battling from, quote, \\\"stress and fatigue\\\". Also feeling stress and fatigue, no doubt -- probably a lot more -- the workers struggling to bring those reactors under control on little sleep and just two meals a day. We have new details tonight on just why it is that workers are having such a hard time eating. The problem isn't just finding uncontaminated food, we're told. It's finding an uncontaminated space to eat it in. TEPCO says the workers will soon start getting three meals a day, possibly tomorrow. This, though, only after the information has been revealed that they weren't getting three meals a day. The company also says it's hoping to get workers staples like bread and soup very soon. That's right. They haven't had bread or soup. They've had a lot of crackers. For now, they're powering through on meals nothing more than rice and a special protein mix, occasionally crackers, because they come in sealed packages. As for a reported shortage of protective gear, TEPCO admits supplies may be running short, but they claim there is still enough protective clothing for everyone who's working at the site, and they're buying more as they need it. Joining us now with the latest in the battle to bring the Fukushima Daiichi plant under control: from Hong Kong, former senior nuclear power plant operator Michael Friedlander; and in L.A., our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Michael, do you believe this company, TEPCO, now? I mean, I've got to say, given the lack of information, the lack of flow of information that we've had, really, since day one in this thing, the misinformation that we've been given, and we've seen workers getting doused with radioactive water, do you believe that they have the right protective gear?\"\n",

When the Russians were defeated by Afghan fighters and by the Arabs who went to fight against them in the name of jihad, these Arabs went home and they became the heroes and around them formed groups and cells.

So what we've said is, if we can control health care inflation -- how fast costs are going up -- then not only can we stabilize the Medicare trust fund, not only can we help save families money on their premiums, but we can <ACTUALLY> afford to provide coverage to the people who currently don't have health care. Now, here's the problem, that in order for us to save money, in some cases, we've got to spend some money up front. Let me give you some very specific examples. Health care I.T. -- health care is the only area where you still have to fill out five different forms. When you go into a bank, you don't have to do that. You've got an ATM. If you use your credit card, they'll find you real quick and the billing is real easy, right? But for some reason, when you go into health care, you fill out pencil and paper. I guess they Xerox it. They give it to somebody else. Sometimes you see their files, and it's all stuffed with papers, and nurses can't read the doctor's handwriting. So for us to set up a system like they have at the Cleveland Clinic that I just visited in Ohio, where every medical record -- your privacy is protected -- but everything is digitalized, everything -- the minute you take a test, it goes to all the doctors and all the specialists that you might end up dealing with. So you end up just having that one test instead of having to then go back to the doctor again and again and again and have a bunch of different tests. <WELL>, that saves money, but you've got to get the computer equipment in the first place to do it. So, in some cases, we've got to spend some money on the front end. I also think that, if we provide coverage for people who don't have health insurance right now, then they are going to be getting preventive care, they're going to be getting screenings, and so they don't end up in the emergency room with really expensive care that all of us are paying for, even though we don't know it. The average family is spending about $900 a year in higher health care premiums because they are paying indirectly for uncompensated health care. Essentially, the insurance companies charge you a little more and hospitals and doctors, they're all charging you a little bit more because they're not getting reimbursed for people who don't have any care whatsoever. So what we've done is we've said, <LOOK>, over 10 years, the health care reform proposals to cover everybody would cost about a trillion dollars over 10 years, so that's about $100 billion a year. Keep in mind we spend $2 trillion every year on health care, so this is just a fraction of what we spend. But we're talking about a trillion dollars over 10 years. That's $100 billion a year. About 60 percent of that can be paid for by taking money that's already in the system but isn't working to make you healthier. That can pay for about 60 percent of it. So, really, what we're talking about is another $30 billion to $40 billion every year to cover everybody, and we're going to get most of that money back if we're providing more prevention, more wellness, doctors and hospitals are being reimbursed more intelligently. Over time, that money -- that investment will more than pay for itself. But Ali (ph) is exactly right. <YOU KNOW>, you get these stories where, oh, there's a trillion dollars here, a trillion dollars there, after a while, it starts being real money, even here in Washington. And so I understand people being scared that this is going to be way too costly. It's not that costly if we start making changes right now.\"\n",

And what the people here have learned is, they can tolerate a Category 2 hurricane very well. Of course, this is the southern edge of the hurricane warning zone. But they have had huge problems here in the past with smaller storms with floods. But what's happened in this storm is, the winds have blown from my left. And over to my left is the Intracoastal Waterway, which separates this island from the North Carolina mainland. By the way, we're near Camp Lejeune, where we spent a lot of time before, during and after the war. Three blocks wide, this island. The other side of me is where the Atlantic Ocean is. And because this is such a narrow sliver of land, 26 miles long, but only three blocks wide, they've had a lot of problems with flooding. But the winds have blown towards the ocean and they've had almost no flooding whatsoever. We've driven up and down this island, and then to the north, towards Morehead City. And we can tell you, while there is some damage, so far, we haven't seen any major damage of any kind here or north of here, closer to where the eye was. And that's the good news. Behind me, there is a bridge. That is the major bridge. It takes people off Topsail Island to the mainland. That bridge will be shut down until 9:00 tomorrow morning. Officials say it's only for emergency vehicles. So anyone on this island who decided to stay who wants to get off it will have to wait until at least tomorrow morning. The winds are still strong.

In the process of reaching out to the world's 1.5 billion Muslims with today's speech, it's unclear if President Obama, in the process, was also pushing away America's longtime ally, Israel. Speaking in Cairo, the president recognized the U.S.' \\\"unbreakable bond\\\" with the Jewish state and the horror of the Holocaust, but he also talked about the suffering of the Palestinian people. He described their situation as intolerable, and he stressed the need for a two-state solution. President Obama called on Palestinians to abandon violence, pointing to America's own civil rights history and saying that it was a peaceful and determined insistence that brought about equal rights for African-Americans. And he once again called upon Israel to stop building the settlements and to allow Palestinians to live and work and develop their own society. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already rejected President Obama's call for a freeze on those settlements, but experts suggest that this demand from Mr. Obama will make the Arab world <LISTEN>. They say although the U.S. has been opposed to Israeli settlements for decades, past American presidents have looked the other way and allowed Israel to just keep building them. And some believe that if \\\"no\\\" really means \\\"no\\\" this time around, <WELL>, it may be easier to form a regional coalition against Iran. And speaking of Iran, Mr. Obama repeated his belief today the Islamic republic has the right to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes. That's another statement that's probably not going to sit real <WELL> with the Israelis. And finally, for the first time in a long time, a visit to the Middle East by a sitting U.S. president did not include a stop in Israel. So here's the question: Is President Obama reaching out to Muslims at the expense of America's relationship with Israel? Go to cnn.com/caffertyfile and post a comment on my blog.

I want to, first of all, thank the leadership of Secretary Condi Rice and Secretary Don Rumsfeld. During those discussions, we talked about the need to transform our military to meet the threats of the 21st century. We discussed the global war on terror. We discussed the situation on the ground in three fronts of the global war on terror: in Lebanon and Iraq and Afghanistan. Friday's U.N. Security Council resolution on Lebanon is an important step forward that will help bring an end to the violence. The resolution calls for a robust international force to deploy to the southern part of the country to help Lebanon's legitimate armed forces restore the sovereignty of its democratic government all Lebanese territory. As <WELL>, the resolution is intended to stop Hezbollah from acting as a state within the state. We're now working with our international partners to turn the words of this resolution into action. We must help people in both Lebanon and Israel return to their homes and begin rebuilding their lives without fear of renewed violence and terror. America recognizes that civilians in Lebanon and Israel have suffered from the current violence. And we recognize that responsibility for this suffering lies with Hezbollah. It was an unprovoked attack by Hezbollah on Israel that started this conflict. Hezbollah terrorists targeted Israeli civilians with daily rocket attacks. Hezbollah terrorists used Lebanese civilians as human shields, sacrificing the innocent in an effort to protect themselves from Israeli response. Responsibility for the suffering of the Lebanese people also lies with Hezbollah's state sponsors, Iran and Syria. The regime in Iran provides Hezbollah with financial support, weapons and training. Iran has made clear that it seeks the destruction of Israel. We can only imagine how much more dangerous this conflict would be if Iran had the nuclear weapon it seeks. Syria's another state sponsor of Hezbollah. Syria allows Iranian weapons to pass through its territory into Lebanon. Syria permits Hezbollah's leaders to operate out of Damascus and gives political support to Hezbollah's cause. Syria supports Hezbollah because it wants to undermine Lebanon's democratic government and regain its position of dominance in the country. That would be a great tragedy for the Lebanese people and for the cause of peace in the Middle East. Hezbollah and its foreign sponsors also seek to undermine the prospects for peace in the Middle East. Hezbollah terrorists kidnapped two Israeli soldiers. Hamas kidnapped another Israeli soldier for a reason: Hezbollah and Hamas reject a vision of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. Both groups want to disrupt the progress being made toward that vision by Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas and others in the region. We must not allow terrorists to prevent elected leaders from working together toward a comprehensive peace agreement in the Middle East. The conflict in Lebanon is part of a broader struggle between freedom and terror that is unfolding across the region. For decades, American policy sought to achieve peace in the Middle East by promoting stability in the Middle East. Yet, the lack of freedom in the region meant anger and resentment grew, radicalism thrived, and terrorists found willing recruits. We saw the consequences on September 11, 2001, when terrorists brought death and destruction to our country, killing nearly 3,000 of our citizens. So we launched a forward strategy of freedom in the broader Middle East. And that strategy has helped bring hope to millions and fostered the birth of young democracies from Baghdad to Beirut. Forces of terror see the changes that are taking place in their midst. They understand that the advance of liberty, the freedom to worship, the freedom to dissent, the protection of human rights would be a defeat for their hateful ideology. But they also know that young democracies are fragile and that this may be their last and best opportunity to stop freedom's advance and steer newly free nations to the path of radical extremism. So the terrorists are striking back with all the destructive power that they can muster. It's no coincidence that two nations that are building free societies in the heart of the Middle East -- Lebanon and Iraq -- are also the scenes of the most violent terrorist activity. Some say that America caused the current instability in the Middle East by pursuing a forward strategy of freedom, yet history shows otherwise. We didn't talk much about freedom or the freedom agenda in the Middle East before September 11th, 2001; or before Al Qaeda first attacked the World Trade Center and blew up our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in the 1990s; or before Hezbollah killed hundreds of Americans in Beirut and Islamic radicals held American hostages in Iran in the 1980s. History's clear: The freedom agenda did not create the terrorists or their ideology, but the freedom agenda will help defeat them both. Some say that the violence and instability we see today means that the people of this troubled region are not ready for democracy. I disagree. Over the past five years people across the Middle East have bravely defied the car bombers and assassins to show the world that they want to live in liberty. We see the universal desire for liberty in the 12 million Iraqis who faced down the terrorists to cast their ballots and elected a free government under a democratic constitution. We see the universal desire for liberty in 8 million Afghans who lined up to vote for the first democratic government in the long history of their country. We see the universal desire for liberty in the Lebanese people, who took to the streets to demand their freedom and help drive Syrian forces out of their country. The problem in the Middle East today is not that people lack the desire for freedom. The problem is that young democracies that they have established are still vulnerable to terrorists and their sponsors. One vulnerability is that many of the new democratic governments in the region have not yet established effective control over all their territory. In both Lebanon and Iraq, elected governments are contending with rogue armed groups that are seeking to undermine and destabilize them. In Lebanon, Hezbollah declared war on Lebanon's neighbor Israel without the knowledge of the elected government in Beirut. In Iraq, Al Qaeda and death squads engage in brutal violence to undermine the unity government. And in both these countries, Iran is backing armed groups in the hope of stopping democracy from taking hold. The message of this administration is clear: America will stay on the offense against Al Qaeda. Iran must stop its support for terror. And the leaders of these armed groups must make a choice: If they want to participate in the political life of their countries, they must disarm. Elected leaders cannot have one foot in the camp of democracy and one foot in the camp of terror. The Middle East is at a pivotal moment in its history. The death and destruction we see shows how determined the extremists are to stop just and modern societies from emerging in the region. Yet millions of people in Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere are equally determined to live in peace and freedom. They have tired of the false promises and grand illusions of radical extremists. They reject the hateful vision of the terrorists, and they dream of a better future for their children and their grandchildren. We're determined to help them achieve that dream. America's actions have never been guided by territorial ambition. We seek to advance the cause of freedom in the Middle East because we know the security of the region and our own security depend on it. We know that free nations are America's best partners for peace and the only true anchors for stability. So we'll continue to support reformers inside and outside governments who are working to build the institutions of liberty. We'll continue to confront terrorist organizations and their sponsors who destroy innocent lives. We'll continue to work for the day when a democratic Israel and a democratic Palestine are neighbors in a peaceful and secure Middle East. The way forward's going to be difficult. It will require more sacrifice. But we can be confident of the outcome because we know and understand the unstoppable power of freedom. In a Middle East that grows in freedom and democracy, people will have a chance to raise their families and live in peace and build a better future. In a Middle East that grows in freedom and democracy, the terrorists will lose their recruits and lose their sponsors and lose safe havens from which to launch new attacks. In a Middle East that grows in freedom and democracy there will be no room for tyranny and terror, and that will make America and other free nations more secure. Now I'll be glad to answer a couple of questions.\"\n",

October 1973, President Nixon fires Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox in the midst of his investigation into Watergate. The attorney general and his top deputy leave rather than fire Cox. Federal agents seal off the special prosecutor's office. Could a president shut off an inquiry into his own behavior? It didn't happen. A firestorm of public pressure forced Nixon to name a successor, Leon Jaworski, who demanded of Nixon those famous secret tape recordings. And that could have triggered a real constitutional crisis when a unanimous Supreme Court ordered Nixon to turn over the tapes. Suppose he had refused, one branch of government defying the order of another. But it didn't happen. Nixon turned the tapes over, the smoking gun of a cover-up was disclosed and the president resigned. But this? Not even close, yet. What you have so far is the messy, inefficient business of vote counts. Instead of troops in the Capitol, you've got lawyers in the courts. Instead of mobs in the street, street theater, folks with a little too much time on their hands. (on camera): So, could this turn into a crisis? <OF COURSE> we're not talking about anyone seizing political power or some adversary from abroad sailing up the Potomac, but we could be talking about a transfer of power tainted by charges of foul play; an angry challenge to the electoral vote when the new Congress convenes in January; a bitter refusal of the losing side to acknowledge the victor's right to govern; a new Congress that, for all the talk of cooperation, is frozen into inaction by a sense of icy bitterness that's grown over the last 20 years. A crisis? Maybe not. But as an unhappy ending to all this, that would do.\"\n",

Obviously there's existing plans that they probably dusted off and modified for the circumstances for last night. So getting those aircraft in the air, getting those ships armed and ready, not a huge deal. It's really just a matter of targeting and laying those targets into the systems and the sensors. It's likewise pretty quickly to turn something like that off because the military has such robust communications capability. I'm not surprised that they were able to react as quickly as they did to the president's order. So the message on Iran, I found Joe Johns' reporting earlier in the hour very interesting about how the White House didn't push back on \\\"The New York Times\\\" story that the president had made this decision sort of late in the game and that they were OK having that out there. So clearly whatever drove the president to make this decision, and the general kind of outlaid some ideas there, it did have a strategic communications benefit to him, for the president, to have it out there that he was that close, because it sends a strong message to the Iranians that we really do have a robust capability and that they need to take that very seriously going forward.

We understand negotiations -- sorry -- are taking place as we speak now with the prime minister, with the president, and with Sunni negotiators to see if there is any wording that can bring all three sides, the Kurds, the Shia and the Sunnis, on board with this constitution. If not, this process ends, today, Kelly. The drafting process tomorrow will likely begin a fierce debate in the Iraqi public arena over federalism and this constitution. The Sunnis, <OF COURSE>, do have the votes to reject this constitution and the referendum to come by mid October. So that is the question we are waiting to see today, are the Sunnis on board with this draft constitution. Also, though, as you mentioned, violence erupting in the holy city of Najaf, south of Baghdad. A Shia holy city there. Followers of Muqtada al-Sadr erupted in gunfire among demonstrators.

But I do share Mick's sentiment -- Mick served with me in the Budget Committee, which is we can't take nothing for an answer and we cannot allow the status quo on health care. Health care costs are skyrocketing. People are losing choices. The bill that we passed in the House, the whole premise of the bill is to lower premiums and give people more choices. Look, the way I think that matters the most is we believe risk pools are very effective. We had a very, very good high risk pool in Wisconsin. And so when I take -- talk about risk pools, what do I mean when I say that? We believe, as government, federal government, state government, we should fund the care for people with catastrophic illnesses, so that if you get a catastrophic illness, like cancer or heart disease, you don't go broke paying for that health care. And by having direct care in subsidies, like we had in our risk pool in Wisconsin, for people with catastrophic illnesses, you dramatically lower the price of insurance for everybody else. Ten percent of the people in the Wisconsin risk pool, 10 percent of the people were in the risk pool in Wisconsin, the other 90 percent of Wisconsinites in the individual market had much cheaper, much more affordable health care with more choices and lower premiums. That's what we're proposing to do. Have funds for catastrophic illnesses so those people get support. One percent of the people in the individual market drive 23 percent of the costs. So if we basically say we will directly support those -- I don't know -- 8 percent to 10 percent of Americans who have a catastrophic illness, then the insurers only have to fund up to the catastrophic amount, insure up to there. So it's like property and casualty. I mean, we've got the best quarterback in America, Aaron Rodgers, selling us insurance with discount double check. We got a lizard selling us Geico Insurance. Why can't we do it that way with health insurance? And that is basically what we are proposing. So I think what we have offered, make sure that we fulfill the objective we all want: Affordability, accessibility, and making sure that people with pre- existing conditions get good health care at an affordable rate without going broke if they get sick. That is what we're trying to achieve, and that is why we can't take doing nothing for an answer.\",\n",

He's a virtual unknown. Brazile, a Democratic strategist, thinks the key to President Obama's success was that he didn't run as a black candidate, unlike people like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. He ran as a progressive Democrat. Donna Brazile points out that most people thought it would simply make the campaign trail interesting when Obama decided to run. Nobody expected yesterday's events to be the culmination of that decision. But on a cold winter night in Iowa, Barack Obama knocked off Hillary Clinton in arguably the whitest place in America. And it was game on after that. He won primary after primary, including Georgia, Virginia, the former confederacy. And in the general election, he simply mopped the floor with John McCain. The American people didn't see a black man when they looked at Barack Obama. They saw someone who held out hope for a better future for them and their families. It's all pretty amazing stuff.

They have got a dolphin here, and they have got sea turtles, more than 100 sea turtles. We will show you how those sea turtles are being treated, how their lives are being saved, the oil cleaned off, and what's going to happen to them once this disaster is finally over. We will have that later in the program. This is day 71, the oil still gushing into the Gulf, still flooding ashore, Tropical Storm Alex churning the waters, making them too rough to skim for oil. The Coast Guard today ordering those skimmers, those boats specially designed to collect oil off the surface, skimming it off the surface, ordering those boats back into port until the sea calms down. The fact is, you don't need a tropical storm to stymie the skimming. Long before the wind picked up here, it was already tangled in red tape. We are \\\"Keeping Them Honest\\\" -- people down here demanding to know, where is the sense of urgency? I mean, we saw the exact same thing during Katrina, emergency work hampered by people operating from the non-emergency rule books, rules that maybe made sense or might make sense or could have made sense in normal times that seem to make no sense now. Take these skimmers, for instance. There are 433 of them, according to \\\"The Times Picayune,\\\" the local paper in New Orleans. According to the paper, there are more than 1,600 skimmers available elsewhere in the continental United States. They need every skimmer they can get down here, so why not use some of those? <WELL>, it turns out the 1990 Oil Pollution Act requires many of them to be standing by in case of other spills elsewhere. But you would probably say, <WELL>, <LOOK>, the nation's worst environmental disaster is unfolding right here right now. And what does the federal government say to that? <WELL>, not much. Admiral Thad Allen, last week, morning than two months into the disaster, saying that working around the 1990 law is -- and I quote -- \\\"a work in progress.\\\" Is that what you would say if this country is being attacked? Meantime, new waves of oil hitting the shore in Mississippi and Florida, new beach closings in both states, and officials closing the inlet into Pensacola Bay, as a six-square-mile sheet of thick reddish oil patches getting closer. So, what about foreign countries offering up their skimming vessels? <WELL>, it turns out there's a law against that, too, the Jones Act of 1920, intended to prevent foreign ships from taking part in American domestic trade, taking cargo from one American port to the other. The law being interpreted to mean that foreign skimmers cannot pick up oil within three miles of shore, because that's considered a port and dump it -- a port onshore. As of last week, six vessels have applied for waivers to the Jones Act. None has been granted. Other foreign skimmers are working outside the three-mile limit, kept out by red tape. But are they also being stopped by BP to hide the true size of the spill? Tomorrow, a Dallas investment banker is scheduled to testify before a Senate committee. His name is Fred McCallister. He's from a company called Allegiance Capital. He says he's been trying to broker a deal with BP to bring 12 large skimmers from Greece. He made the offer two weeks ago, first believed BP didn't respond because of the Jones Act. Now he's questioning BP's motive, and he's expected to tell the Senate committee tomorrow that BP is trying to disperse and sink the oil, instead of skimming, to serve -- his words -- its own financial interests.

But then you get toward Nashville and it starts to dry out, as does the moisture plume. Nashville, east towards Chattanooga, Knoxville, northern parts of Georgia, that's where we need the rain. It doesn't <LOOK> like we're going to get it. Here is a storm system that's going to come into play tomorrow. <ACTUALLY> for the next several days. An area of low pressure will dive across the Rocky Mountains. Once it gets over the Rockies, it will pick up some energy. They typically do this time of year. They kind of stretch their legs and start to wind up. Then tapping moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. And unlike other storms that have tried to formulate -- form this past fall, this one's going to have some better dynamics. It will get a little bit stronger and it will also, because of that, tap more moisture. So strong storms potential for tomorrow, and again on Thursday, too, as this thing really begins to wind itself up. So tomorrow we're talking across the Plains here and toward Tornado Alley. And then on Thursday, we're talking more widespread, across the Mississippi River Alley and in through parts of the Southeast. That's where we might get some rainfall, but with that rainfall on Thursday or Friday, Heidi, comes the threat for damaging, severe storms. So you don't always get the gentle, longstanding rainfall that you need to relieve a drought, but at this point...\"\n",

CNN has learned that Lay has lost more than $100 million since the end of August, including more than 60 percent of the shares of Enron stock he once owned. What a change. In the past, Lay loaded up on Enron stock. Even as he was cashing in on lucrative stock options, Lay was buying more than he was selling. In late 1998, Lay reported owning fewer than a million shares. But, toward the end of 1999, that had increased to nearly 2 million. Even as the stock price soared from $25 a share to more than $40. And he would add nearly a million more after that, as the price spiked to $80 and $90. He was still buying as late as last August. And stayed bullish. August 20th and 21st, Lay bought a total of 93,620 shares for his portfolio, as he reported on this form to the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the very same time, August 21st, Lay predicted, \\\"a significantly higher stock price,\\\" in an e-mail to a group of employees. In September, he told employees, he'd been buying and they should do the same. In an e-mail chat, he called Enron stock, \\\"an incredible bargain,\\\" at the current price of around $30 a share. A \\\"great opportunity, incredibly cheap.\\\" (on camera): Lay reported his Enron holdings back then at 2.9 million shares of Enron stock. But, then disaster. Lay's attorney, Earl Silbert, told CNN that by late November, as Enron was slipping into bankruptcy, Lay owned only 1.1 million shares of Enron stock. That's a drop of 1.8 million shares. That's 62 percent of Lay's holdings. (voice-over): Silbert told CNN, and others, that Lay lost the shares because he's use them as collateral for money he'd borrowed from Enron. And when Enron's stock price sagged, Lay turned the shares over to the company rather than pay back the cash. How much has Lay lost? The value of the stock Lay said he owned in august was $101 million, at the time, when it was selling for $35 a share. The current value of what's left, at a recently quoted price of 67 cents a share, is well under a million. Lay's loss on Enron stock alone? $100 million. Lay is hardly a poor man. But, in November, he put two houses in Aspen, Colorado, up for sale, asking around $15 million. (on camera): And this much is clear from the record, so far. Lay bought more shares than he sold on the way up and lost a ton when the price collapsed. Brooks Jackson, CNN, Washington.\",\n",

His lawyer's reach out to the FBI, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. As we mentioned, the Senate investigators held their first public hearings today on Russia's meddling in U.S. elections. They said the investigation will go wherever the facts lead. Two nights ago, we laid out some facts about seven Trump associates and their connections to Russia. We ended up with a flow chart, you see there. It looks a lot like a busy subway map. One on those lines connects former Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, to Russian billionaire named Oleg Deripaska. Just today, Russian President Vladimir Putin was asked about the possibility Deripaska appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss his relationship with Mr. Manafort. Putin say, \\\"That's his right. Let him do it.\\\" We don't know if the Senate Intelligence Committee actually plans or if they want to talk to Mr. Deripaska. Tonight, though, there's another connection you should know about. Drew Griffin tonight has the latest.\",\n",

He's <WELL>-known to Russian President Vladimir Putin and has been given awards by the Russian government. There is no indication Donald Trump has ever met Oleg Deripaska, but it turns out the two men do have connections. CNN has learned Donald Trump and Oleg Deripaska's company have over the years shared the same attorney, his name is Mark Kasowitz. And on his website, Kasowitz prominently list President Donald Trump as a client, who he's represented in a \\\"wide range of litigation matters for over 15 years.\\\" Oleg Deripaska isn't on Kasowitz list of clients, but records show Kasowitz is the attorney in a federal lawsuit where he represents an investment vehicle wholly owned by Deripaska, just one attorney with two billionaire clients, perhaps. But consider this. Oleg Deripaska has another shoestring connection to Donald Trump and it's tied to this man. Donald Trump's former campaign chief, Paul Manafort. Manafort and Deripaska are former business partners. The Republican strategist who ran Trump's campaign for five months also started several offshore companies with Oleg Deripaska. Legal filing show the Russian billionaire entrusted nearly $19 million to Manafort in 2008, the money to be invested in the Ukrainian telecom business. It was part of a major deal to make \\\"significant long term capital.\\\" But the investment and relationship fell apart. For several years, Deripaska tried to contact Manafort and get answers about the missing money. Court papers filed in 2014 showed Deripaska's attorneys had not been able to reach Manafort and determined Paul Manafort had simply disappeared. Then, Paul Manafort began running Donald Trump's campaign in 2016 and Deripaska's legal claims against him appeared to have gone away. Manafort spokesman tells CNN, \\\"Mr. Manafort believes the matter is dormant and will not be pursued further.\\\" Ethics expert and CNN Contributor Larry Noble says while there may be nothing inherently wrong with Kasowitz representing both Trump and Deripaska in unrelated matters --\"\n",

So that is the divorce part. That's the 585-page document that we got last week. Now, that draft text is all but agreed and I've heard from sources in the EU and also sources in Parliament that that is pretty much a done deal. It's taken them so long to negotiate that part of it. No, the other section of this deal is the political declaration on the future relationship. Now at the moment, I've re-read that just a few moments <ACTUALLY>. It's around eight pages. That gives an overview of what the EU and UK envisage themselves to be like in the future. So how will they trade? What will their security relationship be? How will they conduct foreign affairs with each other? All of these types of issues. Now, that has the potential to be fleshed out. So when people talk about sweetening the deal, a lot of the time, they're referring to trying to add some flesh on the bones of that political declaration because then, people wouldn't feel as much that they were signing up to this deal of 39 billion pounds being handed over to the EU without knowing exactly what Britain was going to get in return or a so-called blind Brexit, which is a really big concern of remainers and pragmatists in the middle here.

They had some very good matches, like the last one against France, but also some very bad ones, like the one before that against Algeria.

Nevertheless, I do sense some confidence among the Brazilian fans. They say they do think that with the support of the crowd, with the support of the nation, they can pull this thing off. Apparently, a company here in Belo Horizonte has even started somewhat of an action here. It's given out 60,000 Neymar masks just to assure the team that at least in spirit, everyone in this town will be a Neymar in some way, shape or form. So, very little confidence on both sides, but a lot of hope on both sides, I would say. And I have to say, the fans are very, very fair and very good to each other.

The reason Anthony Scaramucci is doing this, obviously, John Kelly fired him, also he has recently limited his access to the White House. But what's stunning is while the president is tweeting and bemoaning reports of any kind of chaos in the West Wing, he's in part sowing some of that chaos himself by setting up this argument between his former communications director and his current chief of staff.

He was held hostage at gunpoint by Somali pirates. Navy SEAL snipers rescued him yesterday. They killed three of his kidnappers. The fourth one was captured. Breaking news also this morning out of Bangkok where Thai soldiers are clashing with protesters blocking roads in the capital. Seventy people reported injured. The demonstrations come just a day after Thailand's ousted prime minister called for a revolution. And the average price of gas down a bit this morning to $2.05 a gallon. That's half the record high we hit last summer. Prices are nearly a dime though over what they were three weeks ago. New Jersey has the cheapest gas in the nation, $1.87 a gallon. And right now, the latest developments on the end of this five- day hostage crisis in the Indian Ocean. American ship captain, Richard Phillips, is free and he's in good health this morning, resting comfortably on a U.S. warship. He was rescued Sunday. Navy SEAL snipers killing three Somali pirates who took him hostage. A fourth kidnapper is in U.S. custody and he could spend the rest of his life in a U.S. prison. Somali pirates already holding more than a dozen ships and 200 hostages still are now vowing to retaliate. Shane Murphy was second in command on board the Maersk Alabama when Captain Phillips was kidnapped. His father, Joseph, knows a thing or two about the pirates who confronted his son's ship.

      "        \"statement\": \"Thank you, Mr. President. I thank you for your kind invitation to visit Washington and for the opportunity to meet with you in discuss the main issues in our common agenda. Our meeting was enlightening. And I <LOOK> forward to working closely with you in the coming years to deepen the friendship, understanding and bilateral ties between the United States and Israel. I also recall our meeting in the city hall when you and I were strolling around the beautiful building at the terrace of the sixth floor watching the walls of the city of Jerusalem. At that time, you were the governor; I was the mayor. And <I THINK> none of us thought that the day would come that I would have the honor and the privilege of being hosted by you as president of the United States and prime minister of Israel. I could sense, then, your deep connection to the Holy Land and your friendship and commitment to the state of Israel. I must say, Mr. President, that my instincts did not fail me. I and the entire people of Israel appreciate your true friendship and unwavering commitment to Israel's security and its <WELL>-being as a vibrant Jewish state. Your involvement in the Middle East and personal contribution to the effort toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been significant. The vision which you outlined in your historic speech of June 2002 of two democratic states living side by side in peace and security is the basis of any progress toward a solution in this region. Your unreserved support of the disengagement plan and your letter of April 14th, 2004, to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon -- and I join you in praying for his recovery -- were the basis for the success of its implementation. What you immediately recognized to be a historic step was later adopted by all those who were skeptical in the beginning. I intend to exhaust every possibility to promote peace with the Palestinians according to the road map, and I extend my hand in peace to Mahmoud Abbas, the elected president of the Palestinian Authority. I hope he will take the necessary steps which he committed to in order to move forward. Unfortunately, the rise of Hamas, a terrorist organization which refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist and regards terrorism as a legitimate tool, severely undermines the possibility of promoting a genuine peace process. As you stated, Mr. President, the Palestinian Authority headed by Hamas government must abandon the path of terrorism, dismantle the terror infrastructure, honor agreements and recognize Israel's right to exist. By doing so, they will find us a willing partner in peace. However, we will not enter into any kind of partnership with a party which refuses to recognize our right to live in peace and security. Despite our sincere desire for negotiations, we cannot wait indefinitely for the Palestinians to change. We cannot be held hostage by a terrorist entity which refuses to change or to promote dialogue. If we come to the conclusion that no progress is possible, we will be compelled to try a different route. I have presented to the president ideas which I believe could help advance his vision and prevent a political stalemate. According to these ideas, we will remove most of the settlements which are not part of the major Israeli population centers in Judea and Samaria. The settlements within the population centers would remain under Israeli control and become part of the state of Israel as part of the final status agreement. This process of realignment would reduce friction between Israelis and Palestinians, ensure territorial contiguity for the Palestinians, and guarantee Israel's security as a Jewish state with the borders it desires. The implementation of these ideas would only be possible with the comprehensive support of the United States and the international community. I anticipate working with you to explore ways to advance this. We discussed the Iranian issue. The Iranian regime, which calls for Israel's destruction, openly denies the Holocaust and views the United States as its enemy, makes every effort to implement its fundamentalist religious ideologies and blatantly disregards the demands of the international community. The Iranian threat is not only a threat to Israel; it is a threat to the stability of the Middle East and the entire world. And it could mark the beginning of a dangerous and irresponsible arms race in the Middle East. Mr. President, we appreciate your efforts to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions, including through the U.N. Security Council. They are of crucial importance. The international community cannot tolerate a situation where a regime with a radical ideology and a long tradition of irresponsible conduct becomes a nuclear weapons state. This is a moment of truth. It is still not too late to prevent it from happening. I thank you again for your gracious hospitality and for our discussions. I <LOOK> forward to continue working with you, Mr. President. Thank you very much.\"\n",

We will support our CBP officers, our border patrol agents. We will treat every single American with the dignity and respect that they are owed as Americans and as human beings, and if we are really serious about security, we have a golden opportunity, republicans, independents, democrats alike, to work on comprehensive immigration reform to rewrite this country's immigration laws in our own image with our own values and in the best traditions of the United States of America. (Crowd Cheers) For all of the veterans here in El Paso, a community that has distinguished itself in service to country going back to Marcelino Serna in World War I, an undocumented immigrant who went over to France with the U.S. Army and came back the most highly decorated veteran from the state of Texas, to the Bolanos brothers in Vietnam, to every man and every woman who right now has their life on the line for this country, if we truly appreciate your service not only will we make sure that we make the investments in the V.A. to care for you when you return from having born the battle especially for those conditions connected to service in combat, posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, we will also ensure that there is a roof over the head of every single veteran who's sleeping on the streets tonight. (Crowd Cheers) And then if we really mean it, if we really mean it, we will ensure that this country does not start yet another war before every peaceful, diplomatic, nonviolent alternative is explored and pursued and those wars that we ask our fellow Americans, these service members to fight on our behalf, 17 years and counting in Afghanistan, 27 years and counting in Iraq, let's bring these wars to a close and bring these service members back home to their families, to their communities, and to their country.

When the western world faced the existential threat of Nazi Germany more than 80 years ago, this country harnessed the political will of hundreds of millions here of the western democracies not only to win that war for the following 80 years to make this world safe for democracy and to lift millions in this country into the middle class. This is our opportunity right now to do something for a far greater existential threat, to do more not just for those here with us today but for the people of the future, our kids and grandkids and every generation that succeeds them. (Crowd Cheers) We have to once again reassert our role on the world stage in order to do this, but if we're going to do that, we've got to strengthen these historic friendships and alliances, so many of them forged in sacrifice, the service of men and women who put their lives on the line and lost their lives to this country. Let's make sure that that sacrifice was not squandered. Let's make sure that we strengthen those alliances. Let's end these love affairs with dictators and strong men all over the world. (Crowd Cheers) Let's earn - let's earn the respect of the people around the world, not just by how we treat those in other countries but how we treat those within our country. (Crowd Cheers) And how we treat those at the border of our country. If we do that, we can make sure that we once again become the indispensable nation convening the other nations of this planet around some of our shared challenges like climate change, like nuclear disarmament, like ending all these wars that we are currently engaged in. We can do for ourselves what no other country can and we have an opportunity at this moment to reprioritize this hemisphere, those countries and people who are literally connected to us by land. We can try to solve the problems of Central America. We can invest in the opportunities to help the people of Central America where they are at home. It is our choice. (Crowd Cheers) But to do any of this, we've got to understand that our country's success depends on the success of this democracy. It is the single greatest mechanism that humankind has ever devised to call forth the power, the potential and the genius of a people around their challenges and their opportunities and so every single citizen must be able to vote and every vote must count. (Crowd Cheers) As president, I will sign into law a new Voting Rights Act. Together we will end gerrymandering. (Crowd Cheers) We will get big money out of our politics (Crowd Cheers) and all across this country we will have automatic and same-day voter registration. That's how we're going to do it. (Crowd Cheers) A full political democracy is only possible if we vigorously pursue a true economic democracy. Every child, every man, every woman in this country must be able to see a future for themselves in this country. Otherwise this country will have no future as a democracy. That means that this extraordinary, unprecedented concentration of wealth and power and privilege must be broken apart and opportunity must be shared with all.\"\n",

I think it's indicative of how much significance the Pope Francis attaches to this undertaking that he was able to set aside protocol like that. I mean, you mentioned that this will not be the first papal visit to Cuba. John Paul first went in '96, Benedict XVI in 2012. But the difference, Victor, this is the first papal visit after the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba. That, of course, happened last December. Both President Obama and President Raul Castro of Cuba have said it would not have happened without the pope's personal diplomatic involvement. So, this is the kind of pivotal moment in which Cuba is attempting to sort of retake its place in the community of nations and mend fences, particularly with its most important relationship in the hemisphere. I think Francis, the history's first pope from Latin America, believes he has a pivotal role to play in that process. And so, you can bet he is taking this trip very seriously. I think it's worth saying that stop in Cuba is going to come en route to France's first visit to the United States in late September when he will be in Washington, New York, and Philadelphia. I think, symbolically, he wanted that stop in Cuba to be packaged with the stop in the United States.

European law enforcement officials say they now have hard evidence linking shoe bomb suspect, Richard Reid, to one of Osama bin Laden's European cells. We'll have a live report on this in just a moment. U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan are at the site where suspected al Qaeda members were killed in a missile attack. A remotely-controlled predator spy plane fired a missile at a group of people on Monday. Officials say at least three were killed, including one who may have been a senior al Qaeda leader. Police in Karachi, Pakistan, say kidnapped \\\"Wall Street Journal\\\" reporter, Daniel Pearl, was lured into a trap by a series of e-mails. The e-mails promised an interview with a militant linked to shoe bomb suspect, Richard Reid. Three men detained for questioning this week were formally charged today with kidnapping Pearl. Members of a Senate committee expect that the former Enron chief, Kenneth Lay, will testify before Congress next week. However, Lay's spokeswoman says Lay has not made up his mind. Earlier indications were that Lay would take the fifth amendment, but senators say that does not appear to be the case now. Lay was subpoenaed to testify after he canceled a scheduled appearance this week.

But after about four years things change and I just want to read part of your piece and I'm going to let you weigh in, OK? You said, \\\"In reviewing filings from the Eric Trump Foundation and other charities, it's clear that the course wasn't free, that the Trump organization received payments for its use, part of more than $1.2 million that has no documented recipients past the Trump Organization. Golf charity experts say the listed expenses defy any reasonable cost justification for a one-day golf tournament.\\\" So explain this, where did the money go?\",\n",
      "        \"statement\": \"<WELL>, that's the big question. <YOU KNOW>, what we know is that in 2011 after years of running this without big expenses, Donald Trump comes in and he tells his son and the charity I know that you're doing a good thing. I know this is for kids of cancer. But you're holding this in my course and we're going to charge you. And so they are charging him. And you can see the expenses go up immediately when he does that. And they continue to inflate over the years, keep on creeping up, keep on creeping up. And as that's going on the accounting that the foundation is doing doesn't make much sense. They list one golf tournament every year and the numbers seem too high to be just one golf tournament. And then you have former board members who are saying <WELL>, sometimes we would count other events that we worked with, some years we wouldn't. But they always only listed as one event. There's a lot of murkiness there. The one thing that we know is that Donald Trump's company is getting paid by his son's charity.\"\n",

Lightning sparked the fire more than two weeks ago. It's one of nine big fires burning across Idaho. But in the southeast, the problem is too much water, more rain and flooding expected this week. Six inches of rain fell in southern Mississippi on Sunday turning roads into rivers. Flooding has not been this bad since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In England, outrage grows after the partner of newspaper reporter Glenn Greenwald is detained under a UK terrorism act. David Miranda, that's him on the left, was released after nine hours of questioning. This is according to the \\\"Guardian\\\" newspaper. No charges were filed but Miranda's computer, cell phone and other items were confiscated. Greenwald, who's on the right, works for the \\\"Guardian\\\" newspaper and broke the story about the secret surveillance programs in the United States.

It concerns Pim Fortuyn, who was a right-wing politician. The Netherlands is due to go to the polls later this week. And he was basically gunned down in the street in Holland. Why this was extraordinary was because he was right-wing, he was himself gay and he was <ACTUALLY> -- had a huge amount of support. What we have been learning about politics in The Netherlands in the last week is that his policies were anti-immigration. He was anti-Muslim in many cases. And he was garnering an enormous amount of support. Now, he has been assassinated. What everybody is looking at is to see whether Dutch voters, when they go to the polls, will <ACTUALLY> take this far-right turn.

So that's the tragic side of the week that we have been covering and we've all been talking about in Europe. The happy side, or at least the happy ending was the baby who was snatched -- she was one of twins, and she was snatched from the maternity unit of a local hospital. Basically what a teenager did was walk into the hospital and walk out with a baby. A teenager was arrested. Now, why this is particularly interesting, Jack, is that several years ago, the rules were supposed to be tightened to prevent exactly this sort of thing from happening. It didn't happen, and journalists across the country have been going in and out of hospitals pretending to be parents, not walking out with babies, but just proving that, <OF COURSE>, it can be done. The bizarre, one was not amused, Mr. Cafferty, at least according to her majesty. <LOOK>, if you -- this could disturb your breakfast. Be careful, be very careful. This was the man who decided to streak in front of the queen. All right? Now, <LOOK>, just to make it clear, that's the queen, that's the streaker. Remember: queen, streaker, just in case you are getting a little bit confused. He ran for 50 yards next to the queen's car. She was apparently not amused. Prince Philip thought it was all a great hoot. But this is the best thing (ph). He was then rugby tackled.

I was with government officials when word came in that the \\\"Carl Vinson\\\" was heading back to this region. And they called it just another provocative act by the United States. This government believes that the U.S. is the reason why they have to build nuclear weapons. Why they need a viable intercontinental ballistic missile with a nuclear tip capable of reaching the mainland U.S. Because their government tells them that these weapons of mass destruction are essentially the key to their survival as a nation. And that the United States would rain bombs down on their homes here in Pyongyang if their country doesn't develop these weapons. And they explain that is why people live in economic hardship. Why many people don't have enough electricity or have insufficient food at times. They say that these are the sacrifices that they must make in order to develop weapons, to protect this country and to protect the North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un. This is a big week for Kim. The Supreme People's Assembly happening tomorrow, the annual political gathering where delegates will vote in favor of what the leader presents before them. And then on Saturday, it's the biggest holiday of the year here in North Korea, the day of the son celebrating the birthday of North Korea's founder. Around this particular holiday, North Korea in the past has engaged in what the world considers very provocative behavior including five years ago when they attempted and failed to launch a satellite into orbit. U.S. and South Korean officials looking at the latest satellite data believe that North Korea could push the button on its sixth nuclear test at any time. And that certainly would be a way for Kim Jong-un to send a very strong message to the United States, a message of defiance on a week when he wants to project power and strength both here in North Korea and also to his enemies around the world.

She felt as though that the President brought comfort to many of the victims there at Miami Valley Hospital. And so I think there's a little bit of confusion as to why the President said that the Mayor and Senator Brown were lying. I can tell you that the Mayor was very critical, very frustrated with the overall visit in terms of the President's non-response to trying to get something concrete, some sort of commitment from the President in terms of what if anything that he would do about gun safety legislation going forward. She made it very clear that she was very frustrated that that subject was brought up over and over again and the President said at one point, \\\"Yes, we're going to do something,\\\" but was not specific about what that something would be. And so perhaps the President was upset about the Mayor revealing that. We'll have to go back to the President and asked him about that.

Expect to see the Taliban do what they always do, both fight and to a certain extent, melt away into the darkness to wait it all out. But this is the strategy that the Obama administration is so convinced is going to work. Move in, push them out of the towns and villages, get them out of their strongholds, and give them no place to come back to. Because while the fighting is going on, U.S. troops will also be offering aid, reconstruction and assistance to the people in this area.

Donald says \\\"prepare for Brexit plus, plus,\\\" as he puts it. Let's take a look at where we are. You have to say advantage Clinton heading into the vote count tomorrow, why? Because she has this four point lead in our poll of polls, that's a bigger lead than President Obama had over Mitt Romney four years ago. It's a bigger lead than George W. Bush ahead of John Kerry back in 2004 the last time the republicans won the White here. So you have to say here advantage Clinton. Now we pick president state by state, we've talked about that quite a bit so let's look at some of these key states, these four especially getting a lot of attention on the final days. In North Carolina, Clinton plus two, gettable for Trump, but Clinton advantage. Florida has been a dead heat to the end. The closest state back in 2012, guess what, we're going down to the wire in Florida. Again, Pennsylvania, again getting attention today, Clinton plus five there. That gets harder for Donald Trump that's why he's pushing so hard for those blue collar votes. Tonight, New Hampshire, Clinton plus three. Again, Donald Trump back in New Hampshire tonight tried to get the white working class to reverse the Clinton leads in those states. So, it's a big challenge for Trump. Let's look at the scenarios in terms of the road to 270. Here is where we stand in the CNN electoral count, 268 for Clinton, 204 for Trump. Even most republicans in Nevada concede because of all the early voting, we could take this one probably out of the tossup and give it to Clinton. Now this is significant, Don, because that gets to over to finish line 274. What can Donald Trump do to win? Well, let's start first with the democrat's scenario. Some democrats think this is actually conceivable. Democrats think Donald Trump will probably get Arizona in the end. But the democrats actually think especially because of early voting and superior organization. They can do one, two, and three. That would be a blowout, 322 for Clinton, 215 for Trump, not included in this map one from a congressional district here and one from a congressional district there in Nebraska. But if this scenario played out it's a blowout for Clinton. However, here is Trump's biggest, if you will, more reasonable scenario. Number one win Florida, number two, win North Carolina, number three try to win New Hampshire, that gets him to 263. At that point he just needs to turn a blue. It could be Pennsylvania, it could be Michigan, it could be Wisconsin, just needs to turn one of the blues he's been targeting. Let's assume though for the sake of argument that Clinton takes New Hampshire, then Donald Trump, Pennsylvania would be enough. Michigan would be enough in that scenario, but here we go, Don. Let's make it a little more worse case for Donald Trump. What if Clinton wins North Carolina. Trump takes Florida but Clinton takes North Carolina. This is where it gets tough for Trump, 293 to 244 to that scenario. What Donald Trump would have to do then is take Pennsylvania, New Hampshire wouldn't be enough. See, let's go there. Then it's not enough unless he wins both of the congressional districts. So the challenge for Trump could be in the end to do one and two. Now democrats say that's unreasonable, 1988, in 1988, the last time those two states went democratic. So, democrats say we head into the final day with an advantage. But Trump path to 270 they believe are unreasonable, but Trump says he's going to surprise us, Don, Brexit, Brexit, we'll be counting them this time tomorrow.\",\n",

Here's where you served in the Clinton administration, back in 1993, and you look at it; it goes from $4.37 trillion up to $12.1 trillion, the government now authorized to borrow. And Congress is going to raise that up a bit even more; $1.4 trillion, record budget deficit last year. And yet, Larry Summers, even as families around the country have to cut their budgets or make concessions, Congress is going to vote today on a spending bill that will give some Cabinet agencies, a dozen Cabinet agencies, sometimes nine, sometimes 10, and some departments, as much as a 12 percent spending increase. This administration says next year will be the focus and discipline on debt reduction. Why not draw a line now and say now we need to start, and that's too much spending?\",\n",

First, if people study your graph slowly, carefully, they'll see that the debt was <ACTUALLY> going down in the late years of the Clinton administration.

And that's why the 10-year deficit projection that President Obama inherited was $8 trillion. That's what happened. And President Obama recognizes that we've got an obligation to fix it. Frankly, for the next year or two, priority number one -- certainly this year, priority number one has to be job creation. That's why we're putting people directly to work. But then the priority has to be getting the country's finances under control. That's going to be very clear in the rigorous budget that the president proposes. That's clear in how the president, with the very strong support of Secretary Geithner, has administered the -- the TARP program. Just this week we were able to announce that more than $200 billion improvement in the projection on that program. We're starting to collect the funds back with interest and dividends on a substantial scale. The Bank of America, for example, paid back some $45 billion that's now available for taxpayers. We're very focused. The president has said that, on health care, we are not going to put into place -- he is not going to sign any legislation that increases the deficit at all.

You try to knock it out on jurisdictional grounds before you even get to the merits of the case.

So he thought, wait a second, what would the U.S. Supreme Court be most amendable to addressing if indeed this case has to go to the U.S. Supreme Court on an expedited basis.

The sand kicking up on the beach. Intermittent rain showers here. But the real concern over there. Not even 100 miles east of where I am, Hurricane Dorian, the most powerful storm ever to make landfall in the Atlantic basin is over Grand Bahama Island right now, causing devastation. Catastrophic devastation. This storm has all but stalled over the Bahamas, wreaking havoc there. It has been there for hours now. Hours more still to go. The wind speeds at this moment are 165 miles per hour, but they've been much greater than that, and they've had gusts upwards of 200 miles an hour. The storm is inching through the Bahamas, and the concern is what happens then. Again, over my shoulder now, just about 50 miles, it's expected to take a turn to the north. But if it wobbles, if it drifts, it could have a devastating impact here on the Florida coast, as <WELL>. Even if it doesn't move from its projected path, hurricane-force winds expected up and down the Florida coast, not to mention Georgia and South Carolina, as <WELL>. There are hurricane warnings already in several counties in Florida, including where I am right now. That means they can expect the power of a hurricane. Storm surge warnings, as <WELL>. Where I'm standing, they're expecting a storm surge of 4 to 6 feet. It's low tide right now. Very likely that where I'm standing will be covered in water as this storm moves up the Florida coast. Mandatory evacuations underway in several Florida counties. A little bit later today, they will declare mandatory evacuations in Georgia and South Carolina, as <WELL>. We're going to stay on this all morning long, because the forecast is so very crucial. There really hasn't even been a storm like Hurricane Dorian. So let's get right to Chad Myers in the weather center to get a sense of where things stand at this moment in the very latest modeling. We've got an update from the weather center not long ago.

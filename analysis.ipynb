      "gemini_input: <SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: Here's what's happening right \"Now In The News.\" Two missing boys enjoy their first full day back with their families. One boy had been missing since Monday, the other since October of 2002. They were rescued from a suburban St. Louis apartment yesterday. A suspect is in custody. A winter storm crippling the nation's mid-section -- snow and freezing rain, icy roads, power outages, all of that. The Associated Press reports at least six deaths on ice-covered roads in Oklahoma and Missouri, all the result of traffic accidents. Air travel is also seriously affected and more icy weather is expected. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is in Jerusalem. It's the first stop on a Middle East tour to push the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and to persuade governments in the region to support President Bush's plan to send more U.S. troops to Iraq. President Bush has been talking with Republican congressional leaders at Camp David this weekend. In his weekly radio address the president acknowledged congressional skepticism about his plan to increase troop levels in Iraq. He said those who criticize the plan should come up with a better idea. And you're looking at live pictures right now out of North Carolina where we're awaiting a press conference to begin involving the North Carolina State Attorney General's Office, all involving the Duke lacrosse case -- that very controversial case. We've heard recently that the prosecutor is asking to recuse himself from the case. Perhaps we'll hear some answers today from the state attorney's office -- State Attorney General's Office on that request. From Texas to Illinois, a big winter storm has much of the U.S. mid-section in its icy grips. I've been telling you about that. Look at some of the pictures that we're seeing now out of Missouri. The first wave of the storm moved through. Ice-coated roads and power lines are causing some pretty big problems, and thousands of people across the region lost power when the storm blew in. Pretty similar situation in Oklahoma. Look at those pictures. Work crews are out in force this weekend trying to keep the highways passable. The power went out in parts of that state as ice-coated trees and power lines came tumbling down. And in Austin, Texas, liquid trouble of a different sort -- so much rain lately, rivers and streams there are on the rise. Let's check in with Bonnie Schneider who is keeping a close tab on all of that -- Bonnie.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: All right, thank you so much, Bonnie. Meantime, we want to take you straight to North Carolina there, where the North Carolina State Attorney General's Office is holding a press conference as it relates to the lacrosse -- the Duke team.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: ROY COOPER, N.C. STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL>: Thank you very much. Today I've directed our prosecutors in the Attorney General's Office to accept the request of the Durham district attorney to take over the three Durham cases. What this means is that our office will now serve as the prosecutor for the state of North Carolina in these three cases. This work will be handled by our special prosecutions section here in the Attorney General's Office. This section is available to all district attorneys in the state when there's a conflict or when there are other issues that prevent district attorneys from handling a case. Next week we'll transfer all of the files and documents in this case from the Durham District Attorney's Office to our office. Our prosecutors, as we always do, will conduct a fair, impartial and thorough review of these matters. Agreeing to accept the prosecution of these cases doesn't guarantee a trial, nor does it suggest a dismissal. It simply promises a fresh and thorough review of the facts and a decision on the best way to handle these cases. During the review it's possible that we would need to request additional information to conduct further investigation or recheck information that's already been included in the court file. I anticipate that our prosecutors will seek to meet with witnesses, with investigators and with defense attorneys. Now I wish I could tell you that this case would be resolved quickly, but it's my understanding that there are numerous documents and other information in the district attorney's files and in the court record. Since we have not been involved in the investigation or the prosecution of these cases, all of the information will be new to our office. Any case with such serious criminal charges requires a careful and deliberate review. Now, our goal is to seek justice and truth while respecting the rights of everyone involved. We accept these cases with our eyes wide open to the evidence but with blinders on to all other distractions. In the final analysis the path that these cases travel will be lighted by the law and the evidence alone. Now, as with any criminal case, except during the court proceedings, we cannot discuss the details of this case or any of these cases, nor can we comment on the process that has brought the cases to this point. What I can do is I will try to answer your questions now about how the process will go forward. So we'll go ahead and begin with those questions. I'll be glad to take them.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: QUESTION>: Lisa Morrison (ph) with \"People\" magazine. Have you selected the special prosecutor or prosecutors who are going to handle the case, and are they going to hold similar inquiries\n",
      "<SPEAKER: COOPER>: I have requested that Jim Coeman (ph), who is the head of our prosecution section along with Mary Winstead (ph), who is also a prosecutor in our special prosecution section, to be the primary attorneys to handle these cases. I believe that other attorneys could be involved in the process, but right now I've assigned those two attorneys to handle these cases. It's too early to tell about the February hearing. We are just getting the information over. Clearly it's important that we take time to review matters thoroughly. Of course, it's up to Judge Smith to schedule hearing dates, but I would assume that as soon as we gather the information and have a chance to look it over, we will want to shortly meet with Judge Smith to discuss scheduling issues and other issues as we proceed.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: QUESTION>: In submitting his request for a special prosecutor, what did Durham district attorney Mike Nifong say about why he wanted that and what about the way he handled things will help guide your office in the way you'll handle the cases?\n",
      "<SPEAKER: COOPER>: Well, we'll handle the cases the way we handle all of these cases. Our special prosecution section often gets tough cases, cases that district attorneys are finding too hot to handle or cases where they have conflicts. We will handle it the same way where we will review the evidence impartially, and we will move forward. It was only just yesterday that the Durham district attorney called Mr. Coeman in our office and then sent his request that we take over the case. We have quickly considered it because we think it's important to go ahead and move quickly in this case, and we have accepted the case.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: QUESTION>: Did he say why though, why he wanted to...\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: You've been listening to the North Carolina State Attorney General Roy Cooper say that they have accepted the request coming from the Durham prosecutor, Mike Nifong, to be recused from the Duke lacrosse case. Our legal guys, Avery Friedman, a civil rights attorney and law professor joining us from Cleveland, and Richard Herman, New York criminal defense attorney, joining us from New York. Good to see both of you.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: RICHARD HERMAN, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY>: Hi, Fred.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: AVERY FRIEDMAN, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY>: Nice to see you, Fredricka.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: All right, Richard, I want to begin with you because I know you've had some very strong opinions about Mike Nifong and the job that he's been doing. Did you see this coming or does it still come as much of a surprise that he would request being recused when all along he was quite adamant that he felt strongly about where he was going with the case?\n",
      "<SPEAKER: HERMAN>: Fred, he's obviously sought some independent counsel who is halfway intelligent who advised him that based upon the ethics -- alleged ethics violations and those proceedings, he really has a major conflict and he's really taken away the focus of the case and put it on himself as opposed to the case. So he really -- this is probably, you know, the most intelligent thing he's done since he's gotten this case from the inception but like John Mellencamp said, that song \"And the Walls Come Tumbling Down,\" this is the beginning of the end for this guy. I'm telling you, Fred, this guy is in big trouble and this case is over. There is no way it's going to trial.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: Really. OK, so the ripple effect. You think the case is over. So, Richard, do you see this -- I'm sorry, Avery, do you see this the same way? Is it a precursor for dropping the charges altogether?\n",
      "<SPEAKER: FRIEDMAN>: I actually think that's what's going to happen, Fredricka. But I think -- I love the idea where you have an independent body talking about the path of justice being lighted by the law. Obviously, they took time to prepare this for the press conference -- for the briefing, but the truth is when prosecutors, at least from a prosecutorial perspective, talk about a fresh analysis, they are going to look at everything, and I think Roy Cooper was very clear. This doesn't mean a dismissal. It doesn't mean a prosecution, so from the standpoint of really doing justice, whether or not this case goes away -- and I think it probably will -- the idea that the government protecting the rights of the public will examine the facts anew, and I think that really restores faith in the integrity of the process.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: So I wonder, Avery, if one reads between the lines, while the attorney general said it doesn't necessarily mean that we're ending the case nor does it mean we're advancing the case, at the same time does it sort of say that, you know what? We as a body have made some serious mistakes and this is our opportunity to try to correct them now and that, too, might be rather damaging in terms of public opinion there?\n",
      "<SPEAKER: FRIEDMAN>: Well, that has no reflection on the attorney general's office. I mean, Mike Nifong has messed this case up. No one really disputes that. No one seriously challenges that. I think what's very healthy here is that as Americans when we look to the process and we look for due process and fairness, the fact is there's a fallback, and in this case, North Carolina law provides that a local district attorney can go to the attorney general's office. That's what's happening, so I think any discouragement about how people look at system is really neutralized by the involvement of the attorney general.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: HERMAN>: Fred.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: Yes, go ahead.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: HERMAN>: Fred, I think that the attorney general gave us insight into this when he said we're going to determine this case based on the law and the evidence.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: FRIEDMAN>: Yes.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: HERMAN>: And if they truly are going to do that, Fred, this case will be dismissed.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: Really? Even though he did say there were files that none of his prosecutors had had their hands on yet, it will be new to them?\n",
      "<SPEAKER: HERMAN>: Fred, this is not a sophisticated case. It's really pretty open and shut. Once they read the 168 different versions of what the alleged victim said, I mean, the case is over. There's no evidence at all, Fred, zero evidence here that's credible.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: All right.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: FRIEDMAN>: One point -- one quick point.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: OK, real quick.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: FRIEDMAN>: The point is that this is the first time we've heard that a prosecutor will actually meet with defense counsel. That's a big deal, and that's what good prosecutors do.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: All right. Avery and Richard, thanks so much. You're not going anywhere though because one case that is now fairly new when you're dealing about prosecution, what challenges might prosecutors face as they make their case against this man accused of kidnapping two Missouri boys? Our legal experts will be right back.\n",

One boy had been missing since Monday, the other since October of 2002. They were rescued from a suburban St. Louis apartment yesterday. A suspect is in custody. A winter storm crippling the nation's mid-section -- snow and freezing rain, icy roads, power outages, all of that. The Associated Press reports at least six deaths on ice-covered roads in Oklahoma and Missouri, all the result of traffic accidents. Air travel is also seriously affected and more icy weather is expected. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is in Jerusalem. It's the first stop on a Middle East tour to push the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and to persuade governments in the region to support President Bush's plan to send more U.S. troops to Iraq. President Bush has been talking with Republican congressional leaders at Camp David this weekend. In his weekly radio address the president acknowledged congressional skepticism about his plan to increase troop levels in Iraq. He said those who criticize the plan should come up with a better idea. And you're looking at live pictures right now out of North Carolina where we're awaiting a press conference to begin involving the North Carolina State Attorney General's Office, all involving the Duke lacrosse case -- that very controversial case.

Perhaps we'll hear some answers today from the state attorney's office -- State Attorney General's Office on that request.

      "<SPEAKER: COOPER>: I have requested that Jim Coeman (ph), who is the head of our prosecution section along with Mary Winstead (ph), who is also a prosecutor in our special prosecution section, to be the primary attorneys to handle these cases. I believe that other attorneys could be involved in the process, but right now I've assigned those two attorneys to handle these cases. It's too early to tell about the February hearing. We are just getting the information over. Clearly it's important that we take time to review matters thoroughly. Of course, it's up to Judge Smith to schedule hearing dates, but I would assume that as soon as we gather the information and have a chance to look it over, we will want to shortly meet with Judge Smith to discuss scheduling issues and other issues as we proceed.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: QUESTION>: In submitting his request for a special prosecutor, what did Durham district attorney Mike Nifong say about why he wanted that and what about the way he handled things will help guide your office in the way you'll handle the cases?\n",
      "<SPEAKER: COOPER>: Well, we'll handle the cases the way we handle all of these cases. Our special prosecution section often gets tough cases, cases that district attorneys are finding too hot to handle or cases where they have conflicts. We will handle it the same way where we will review the evidence impartially, and we will move forward. It was only just yesterday that the Durham district attorney called Mr. Coeman in our office and then sent his request that we take over the case. We have quickly considered it because we think it's important to go ahead and move quickly in this case, and we have accepted the case.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: QUESTION>: Did he say why though, why he wanted to...\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: You've been listening to the North Carolina State Attorney General Roy Cooper say that they have accepted the request coming from the Durham prosecutor, Mike Nifong, to be recused from the Duke lacrosse case. Our legal guys, Avery Friedman, a civil rights attorney and law professor joining us from Cleveland, and Richard Herman, New York criminal defense attorney, joining us from New York. Good to see both of you.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: RICHARD HERMAN, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY>: Hi, Fred.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: AVERY FRIEDMAN, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY>: Nice to see you, Fredricka.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: All right, Richard, I want to begin with you because I know you've had some very strong opinions about Mike Nifong and the job that he's been doing. Did you see this coming or does it still come as much of a surprise that he would request being recused when all along he was quite adamant that he felt strongly about where he was going with the case?\n",
      "<SPEAKER: HERMAN>: Fred, he's obviously sought some independent counsel who is halfway intelligent who advised him that based upon the ethics -- alleged ethics violations and those proceedings, he really has a major conflict and he's really taken away the focus of the case and put it on himself as opposed to the case. So he really -- this is probably, you know, the most intelligent thing he's done since he's gotten this case from the inception but like John Mellencamp said, that song \"And the Walls Come Tumbling Down,\" this is the beginning of the end for this guy. I'm telling you, Fred, this guy is in big trouble and this case is over. There is no way it's going to trial.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: Really. OK, so the ripple effect. You think the case is over. So, Richard, do you see this -- I'm sorry, Avery, do you see this the same way? Is it a precursor for dropping the charges altogether?\n",
      "<SPEAKER: FRIEDMAN>: I actually think that's what's going to happen, Fredricka. But I think -- I love the idea where you have an independent body talking about the path of justice being lighted by the law. Obviously, they took time to prepare this for the press conference -- for the briefing, but the truth is when prosecutors, at least from a prosecutorial perspective, talk about a fresh analysis, they are going to look at everything, and I think Roy Cooper was very clear. This doesn't mean a dismissal. It doesn't mean a prosecution, so from the standpoint of really doing justice, whether or not this case goes away -- and I think it probably will -- the idea that the government protecting the rights of the public will examine the facts anew, and I think that really restores faith in the integrity of the process.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: So I wonder, Avery, if one reads between the lines, while the attorney general said it doesn't necessarily mean that we're ending the case nor does it mean we're advancing the case, at the same time does it sort of say that, you know what? We as a body have made some serious mistakes and this is our opportunity to try to correct them now and that, too, might be rather damaging in terms of public opinion there?\n",
      "<SPEAKER: FRIEDMAN>: Well, that has no reflection on the attorney general's office. I mean, Mike Nifong has messed this case up. No one really disputes that. No one seriously challenges that. I think what's very healthy here is that as Americans when we look to the process and we look for due process and fairness, the fact is there's a fallback, and in this case, North Carolina law provides that a local district attorney can go to the attorney general's office. That's what's happening, so I think any discouragement about how people look at system is really neutralized by the involvement of the attorney general.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: HERMAN>: Fred.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: Yes, go ahead.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: HERMAN>: Fred, I think that the attorney general gave us insight into this when he said we're going to determine this case based on the law and the evidence.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: FRIEDMAN>: Yes.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: HERMAN>: And if they truly are going to do that, Fred, this case will be dismissed.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: Really? Even though he did say there were files that none of his prosecutors had had their hands on yet, it will be new to them?\n",
      "<SPEAKER: HERMAN>: Fred, this is not a sophisticated case. It's really pretty open and shut. Once they read the 168 different versions of what the alleged victim said, I mean, the case is over. There's no evidence at all, Fred, zero evidence here that's credible.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: All right.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: FRIEDMAN>: One point -- one quick point.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: OK, real quick.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: FRIEDMAN>: The point is that this is the first time we've heard that a prosecutor will actually meet with defense counsel. That's a big deal, and that's what good prosecutors do.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WHITFIELD>: All right. Avery and Richard, thanks so much. You're not going anywhere though because one case that is now fairly new when you're dealing about prosecution, what challenges might prosecutors face as they make their case against this man accused of kidnapping two Missouri boys? Our legal experts will be right back.\n",

      "  \"Happening now, answering ISIS threats. The White House warns the terror group, \\\"If you come after Americans, we will come after you.\\\" But is the U.S. ready to take that fight beyond Iraq and into Syria? And ISIS warns America, we thirst for your blood. New details on the chilling e-mail sent to the family of a beheaded American. And I'll also speak with the lawmaker who represents the family of another ISIS hostage. And a new controversy in Ferguson. A St. Louis County Police officer who was involved in crowd control is relieved of duty after inflammatory statements. Wolf Blitzer is off tonight. I'm Brianna Keilar. You're in\",\n",
      "  \"Is the U.S. moving toward an all-out war with ISIS? The White House is making it clear that the brutal beheading of an American hostage will not go unanswered.\",\n",
      "  \"If you come after Americans, we're going to come after you wherever you are. And that's going to guide our planning in the days to come.\",\n",
      "  \"That comes a day after a stunning assessment from the Pentagon brass that the ISIS threat is, quote, \\\"beyond anything that we've seen.\\\" The generals made it clear that defeating ISIS would require going after the group inside Syria. We're looking at all angles of this chilling new threat, and we have the latest developments on the investigation of the fatal police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, including some significant details missing from the incident report. Our correspondents and guests are standing by with full coverage including Don Lemon and Jason Carroll in Ferguson. But we begin with CNN White House correspondent Michelle Kosinski. Michelle, tell us the latest on this ISIS threat.\",\n",
      "  \"Brianna, today, the president's deputy national security advisor agreed that the murder of James Foley is ISIS's first terrorist attack against the United States. And without stating it in so many words, he also said essentially that yes, the U.S. is considering air strikes in Syria, but he emphasized that that would require consultation with Congress, a legal justification for doing so.\",\n",
      "  \"Today's assessment of the ISI threat by the White House is serious.\",\n",
      "  \"It's not simply the threat they pose to the United States. It's the threat they pose to the entire world.\",\n",
      "  \"A big jump, though, this talk now about how to contain and ultimately defeat ISIS as the lives of other American hostages hang in the balance from January, when President Obama referred to such groups in an interview as a JV team when compared to al Qaeda. (on camera): Would you still agree with his assessment just a few months ago?\",\n",
      "  \"As they've become better funded through various funding streams, including what they're able to sell in terms of oil and gas, the ransoms they've been able to obtain, and that has developed their capacity in a way that has increased the threat. And they pose a greater threat today than they did six months ago and we're taking it very seriously.\",\n",
      "  \"The administration does agree, though, that ISIS is still mainly involved in regional operations, not the 9/11 level planning of al Qaeda. And today the Department of Homeland Security, FBI sent out a bulletin to law enforcement across America, saying, \\\"There is no credible homeland security threat linked to ISIS.\\\" But warns ISIS is using social media to try to gain followers and that it's urging acts of violence against, quote, \\\"American interests.\\\" And today, the White House would not go so far as to agree with Defense Secretary Hagel's words yesterday.\",\n",
      "  \"This is beyond anything that we've seen. So we must prepare for everything.\",\n",
      "  \"They abduct women and children and subject them to torture, rape and slavery. They have murdered Muslims, both Sunni and Shia, by the thousands. (on camera): So in those terms, is that beyond anything we've seen?\",\n",
      "  \"I -- the president has addressed this a little bit ago.\",\n",
      "  \"Does he agree with Secretary Hagel's assessment, though?\",\n",
      "  \"That what?\",\n",
      "  \"That this is beyond -- a threat beyond anything we've seen, or that ISIS is a force beyond anything we've seen?\",\n",
      "  \"I think how the president views ISIL has been articulated a couple times now.\",\n",
      "  \"The White House has also been saying that one reason ISIS has been able to gain strength, even over the last several months, is the payment of these enormous ransoms by several countries, including European nations. We know that the White House has put some pressure on those countries to stop that practice, but that some have been unwilling to do so. The White House today had some strong words against that, saying that it's the wrong policy, that it gives the terrorists perverse incentives for continuing with the kidnappings -- Brianna.\",\n",
      "  \"Great questioning today. Michelle Kosinski for us on Martha's Vineyard with the president. Thank you. Now, as ISIS and the United States trade public warnings, we are learning more about chilling e-mail exchanges the terror group had with the family of hostage Jim Foley. CNN's Brian Todd here with that. What did you find, Brian?\",\n",
      "  \"Brianna, we have new information tonight about those exchanges, and they are chilling indeed. The last e-mail the family received from his captors before James Foley was killed said, in part, \\\"We will not stop until we quench our thirst for your blood.\\\" It punctuated a series of communications between the two sides where the family appealed for mercy, and Foley's captors never seemed interested in that.\",\n",
      "  \"James Foley's family says they received six e-mails from his captors during the year and a half he was held. The militants at one point demanded more than $130 million for his release, according to the president of Global Post the news agency Foley worked for. Until last week, Foley's family had heard nothing for almost a year. Then an e-mail arrived, saying, \\\"He will be executed as a direct result of your transgressions towards us.\\\" Foley's parents had sent multiple messages to his captors, hoping to engage them. According to the president of Global Post, the family appealed to the captors to show mercy, saying James Foley was an innocent journalist and showed great empathy for the Syrian people. He says the family told the captors they had no control over the actions of the U.S. government. One expert says the family was right to engage the captors.\",\n",
      "  \"I would have said, \\\"Tell me what I can do. Ask me to do something that I can do. You're in charge. The decision for what happens to James is completely your decision. You're completely in charge. Give me something to do that I can do.\\\" And that is actually a great test to find out whether or not the other side is negotiating in good faith.\",\n",
      "  \"The Global Post CEO says he tried to raise money but says there was never any true negotiation between his news outlet and Foley's captors. Now new questions are emerging about the failed Special Operations raid to rescue Foley and other Americans. Pentagon officials say they revealed the mission, because several news outlets were about to report it. Some experts say that disclosure might compromise other rescue missions.\",\n",
      "  \"For one thing, any hostages in Syria now will be dispersed among several sites. They will be more heavily guarded. They may even be wired for demolition and death if -- if any sort of rescue attempt is made in the area.\",\n",
      "  \"In an interview with Yahoo! News, Foley's brother says he wishes the United States had done more.\",\n",
      "  \"You can accomplish both things. The United States could have done more on behalf of the western and American hostages over there and still, you know, dealt with the broader worldwide issue.\",\n",
      "  \"U.S. government officials say they use all the tools at their disposal to try to bring hostages home. They stressed to us they do not grant concessions to hostage takers. And under current U.S. law, paying ransoms would actually be illegal. But in reality, Brianna, no one has ever actually been prosecuted for paying a ransom to a terrorist group.\",\n",
      "  \"Now, ISIS reaches out. They reached out to the Foley family, but as you look at this, are you getting the sense that they were ever really serious about negotiating?\",\n",
      "  \"Experts have told us, and his boss has told us, they don't ever believe that they were ever serious about negotiation. The amount of money they demanded, $132 million, was just too unrealistic, really, for anyone to come up with. And even if they had come up with it, one expert told us they probably have kept moving the goal posts a little bit. Foley's boss did go on record as saying there was never really any true negotiation between his new outlet and the captors. Doesn't mean what happened was inevitable, but at least as far as negotiations, they don't believe they were ever serious.\",\n",
      "  \"All right. Brian Todd, thanks so much. Well, ISIS currently holds three Americans, including journalist Steven Sotloff, who was shown as the end of that horrifying ISIS murder video. And joining me now is Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida. She has been in touch with the members of the Sotloff family. They are residents in her district. Congresswoman, thanks for joining me.\",\n",
      "  \"Thank you so much, Brianna. But I do want to say that we have been helping on the case, along with Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and Congressman Ted Deutsch. But I have not had contact with the family for the last months.\",\n",
      "  \"OK.\",\n",
      "  \"They first contacted me this time last year. They're a very private family. They had not wanted any attention paid to this case. Why? Because they believed that a solution could be found. We had reached out to the Department of State, to the White House, to Reporters without Borders, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch. Any organization or agency that could help. And they were certainly very aware of the case. I had conversations with the White House as recently as yesterday. They are doing everything possible to make sure that Steven is returned to his wonderful parents. They're lovely people. And our community is praying for Steven Sotloff's life and also to give these wonderful parents the strength to continue with this ordeal.\",\n",
      "  \"How hard is it, Congresswoman, to try to make way on a negotiation, or not a negotiation but on trying to get Sotloff and these others released, if paying a ransom isn't on the table? What specifically is being done, besides reaching out to these human rights groups?\",\n",
      "  \"Well, I don't wish to speak for the Sotloff family, because they will be speaking at the proper time. They do live in my community.\",\n",
      "  \"I guess I mean, in general, if you can speak more generally.\",\n",
      "  \"Well, I would say -- I would that as a member of Congress, I would say never pay a ransom, because it only encourages further kidnapping. As a mother and as a grandmother, I would have a totally different response. I would say do everything humanly possible to return my son or my grandson to my loving arms. So this is a very grieving situation for them. I can't fathom how difficult it would be for them to be facing this terrible ordeal with not knowing and Steven's life in the hands of these murderers, barbarians. But we will pray, and as one of the family members said, there's a petition in Change.org. And they ask for people to sign the petition and to continue praying for Steven's life. But ISIS, heaven only knows what this group is capable of. As the mom said, he's still alive. So there's nothing to say.\",\n",
      "  \"Yes. They have reached out, ISIS has, to the Foley family, and we learned from the family that ISIS reached out on multiple occasions. Has ISIS reached out to the Sotloff family?\",\n",
      "  \"I do not know. We just know that they had received a telephone call from their son in December. I don't know, and I don't wish to become part of the Sotloff family saga, because that is a very private family, and they want their privacy to be respected. I can just say that they're a member of our community. We have tried to reach out through many government agencies and nongovernmental organizations. And it was -- it's very difficult to deal with a group that is totally out of control, but prayers for them all.\",\n",
      "  \"I wonder, General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs, he said that ISIS cannot be defeated without addressing the part of it that is in Syria. Do you support air strikes inside of Syria?\",\n",
      "  \"I do. I believe that the president should do that. I believe that he should have done it when he first announced it, when he said Assad has crossed a red line in the use of chemical weapons. In fact, they used chemical weapons twice, and still we did not do what we said we would do. So it was a mistake for us not to act then. Many of us were supportive of the president's actions. And then, when it comes to ISIS or ISIL in Iraq, what we have are natural allies, the Kurds. They're fighters. They want to defeat this horrible terrorist regime, and they will do so if we give them the arms to fight. And so I support limited air strikes, and furthermore, I support arming the Kurds so that they can take ISIL out. We cannot let this cancer grow.\",\n",
      "  \"Yes. And it sounds like arming the Kurds is obviously something very much on the table there. When you did listen to Dempsey's comments yesterday, did you take that? Did you read that?

The local security forces, Becky, as you rightly point out, is a vexed issue. And I think the problem lies in part at least in the fact that the Hodeidah agreement as I know very well first-hand, didn't attempt to resolve the extraordinarily difficult issues of sovereignty in Yemen. Those issues will be resolved in a political solution. The Hodeidah agreement is a stopgap, the humanitarian stopgap, intended to improve the chances of the people of Yemen being able to survive the war. This has come down to a tug of war if you like over who's running the local security forces. The United Nations' role in this is by having the monitors and agencies on the ground to try to make sure that the security forces in both ports and city operate in a professional manner and maintain the security that is their mandate. So we will be there alongside them. I understand why many people in the government of Yemen say but we need to have these forces handed back to us. Well, that wasn't agreed in Sweden. I wish it had been. I hope it will be resolved when we get a political solution. It's my job to try and get an approach to this particular issue which doesn't create an impediment to the demilitarization that I referred to.\",\n",

In both cases, yes, there are interested parties particularly in the south and the pro government forces are dominated by Saudi air, a lot of UAE troops and Sudanese and so on, on the ground. In the Houthi areas, it really was not evident the presence of the Iranians. Nor do the Houthis particularly care to deny that they did get help from the Iranians. What they insisted upon was that they sought help wherever they could get it, the help was relatively small. We've seen some of the evidence in some of the missiles that the Iranians have helped improve. Some of the seaborne IEDs have been actually manufactured parts of them in Iran. But that the Houthis were very fiercely independent of the Iranians and everybody else. That's kind of what they're all about, trying to create this what they would describe as a pure version and uncorrupt vision as they would put it for the future of Yemen.

      "gemini_input: <SPEAKER: MIKE PENCE (R), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES>: ... call be waived?\n",
      "<SPEAKER: UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE>: Without objection.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: PENCE>: Without objection.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: JOHN KING, CNN ANCHOR>: Manu Raju standing by for us. We saw the Vice President of the United States cast his first tie breaking vote. A big tie breaking to get the President of the United States a key member of his cabinet, the Education Secretary Betsy Devos then you had some parliamentary moves at the end of that, Manu, the Senate essentially putting aside any effort to reconsider the nomination. So Betsy Devos, will be sworn in later today, we assume, as the next Secretary of Education. Give us a little flavor.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER>: Yeah. And, you know, even though there was a lot of drama heading up to this, the Republican leadership behind the scenes really worked a lot down the votes. They made sure that there were not going to be any defections. I've been talking to the top Republicans for the last several days, they felt very confident heading into this vote because they got assurances from all their members from some of those blue states, swing state Republicans that you folks were just talking about, people like Dean Heller from Nevada or Pat Toomey from Pennsylvania, that they we're not going to flip, that they were going to support Betsy Devos no matter how much pressure was coming from the left flank of the Democratic caucus. And that was one reason why they moved up for consideration of her nomination to have that before Jeff Sessions' vote to ensure that Jeff Session who was there to help break that 50-50 tie and help it to get to 51-50 situation. Now the Senate moving to the rest of Donald Trump's Cabinet, John, that's right, this vote that's happening at this moment to break a filibuster to block Jeff Sessions from getting the job. Jeff Sessions expected to overcome that filibuster and watch for the Republicans to push through the rest of Donald Trump's cabinet nominees at a very slow pace, much slower than a lot of new presidents but eventually they're going to get their jobs. Democrats doing what they can to frustrate the agenda but not having success so far, John.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: KING>: Not having success so far, Manu, but stay with me and help me with this question. If you need the vice president of the United States to break a tie on one of the President's cabinet picks just to get his team in place, what does that tell us about the environment going forward? The president says he wants fast action. We know at the Whit House they're already frustrated with the pace of Congress but if -- you have to have the vice president break a tie to get you an education secretary, what does it look like as we head into the contentious policy debates about funding a border wall, replacing Obamacare, potentially the whole terror ban issue is spilling up on Capitol Hill, tax reform?\n",
      "<SPEAKER: RAJU>: It's going to be incredibly difficult. This is supposed to be the easy part even though they are getting their nominees, overcoming the Democratic opposition. They have the votes overcome a filibuster, just take 51 senators right know to overcome a filibuster. There are 52 Republican senators. So we expected this to happen all along. It happens slower than they wanted, but it's still happening, but this is the part that they expected to get done. Now, what about when you start getting into the really heavy part of the legislative calendar, getting into the nitty-gritty of healthcare reform, of tax reform. It's going to be incredibly difficult not just to keep Republicans united but to get Democratic support on key issues overcoming that 60-vote threshold which you'll need to pass massive pieces legislation or even the most policy measures, getting of eight Democrats join with 52 Republicans if the Republicans can stay united and, John, this going to frustrate House Republicans who want fast action on a lot of issues, including Obamacare but given how slow the Senate is moving as we've seen with these cabinet nominees, it's going to be very difficult to move quickly on major elements of the agenda so it could spark some infighting which we'll watch for in the coming weeks and months, John.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: KING>: Manu Raju on Capitol Hill for us. We'll check back in if developments. A big victory for the President but needed his Vice President to break the tie to get it. Let's come back into the room. What does it -- it's a win for the President. It looks like he's going to get his entire cabinet. It's also a win for the Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who is keeping the Senate Republicans in line early on. But we're in still in this getting to know you phase, not just about the president and to the conversation we we're just having, don't necessarily pay attention to what he says pay attention to what his team does which I find rather extraordinary (inaudible). But at this moment it's just dawned on me when Manu was speaking, the President is going to go up there. It's not a state of the union because he wasn't president last year, but he's going to go up there in just a couple of weeks and give a joint address to the American people and to the joint session of Congress. He has not done much early on to reach out to the other side. Nor have they done much to reach out to him. Does anyone ever break this ice or is this the world we're going to live for the next four years of the Donald Trump presidency?\n",
      "<SPEAKER: JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT>: I think this is the world that we're going to live in except perhaps on specific issues. If they do actually do something on infrastructure where they need Democrats and bring them in. But this is not what Democrats had planned for. I think they were not planning on all of these protests and they were not planning on their activist for leading them as much now. But now they have to stand up to this President much more I think than they thought they would have to in the moment here and that's going to halt all types of progress there. But I think one other interesting thing, in terms of outreach, it's is something that the, you know, the White house is still not fully staffed in terms of legislative outreach. I mean the Democrats aren't being retentional, but Republicans are baffled by sort of what is happening here. So all of this going on now, as Manu said, this should be the easy stuff.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: KING>: Should be --the Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer just lost this vote because the Vice President broke the tie. This morning he tweeted out just after the vote was finished \"This cabinet nominee is so unqualified, so divisive that that Mike Pence V.P. had to drive down Pennsylvania Avenue to cast the deciding vote.\" For the White House perspective I think they're driving up Pennsylvania Avenue. But, you know, to this point, you know, Chuck Schumer getting into the mix there and trying to prove to the Democratic base, we tried. But to the point we're talking about throughout this, the pressure on the Democrats, their base is pushing them along here. And --.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: LAURA MECKLER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL>: I'm not sure it's really that much of a push, I mean it's not like a lot of this is been on Democrat we're like well, I think Betsy Devos would be a great education secretary. Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: KING>: On Betsy Devos, you're right, but Chucky was about to sit down with Judge Gorsuch.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: MECKLER>: Sure. That's going to be a tougher one, especially for Democrats who have made the argument in the past that you should, you know, look is this person qualified for the court and not look at their ideology which of course is those argument when the shoe is on the other foot. But I do think that -- I don't think she underestimate. It's not that the anger at Donald Trump is not just in the base. I mean I think that the members of Congress, Democrats in Congress feel it, too. And he is not -- his policies are so -- he's taking them to such an extreme and so many different fronts all at the same time without any effort to bring anybody in that I don't think anyone should be real surprised.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: KING>: But if they keep coming up just short, what happens out there in America? Do we get from Democratic activists what we got from the tea party? A revolt saying, you know, trying just coming up just short isn't good enough. We want more -- do you see some primary challenge?\n",
      "<SPEAKER: JACKIE KUCINICH, THE DAILY BEAST>: Well, it all comes down to elections, right? I mean right now Democrats don't really have a lot of power because they've lost a bunch of elections. So if they can mobilize we're already seeing at the town halls. We're already seeing some Republican members really facing a lot of pressure at these local town halls. If that continues and they can continue that momentum, perhaps, they'll see a change. But I mean they can only complain so much because this is what --\n",
      "<SPEAKER: REID WILSON, THE HILL>: The question is how do they mobilize --.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: KUCINICH>: Right.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WILSON>: -- this energy that they have right now. Are they going to focus on winning back the U.S. Senate? At 2018 the map is terrible for Democrats. There are only like two, what is it, eight Republicans who were up and Dean Heller you've mentioned a few times is one of the few Republicans in senate bad shape, maybe and Jeff Flake too, I mean we're reaching here for seats that these can win back. Do they try to win for the House? Gerrymandering has made that a near impossibility. The thing that Democrats should be focusing on right now and the place where they can really get some seats back at the table are governorships. There are huge --\n",
      "<SPEAKER: UNIFENTIFIED FEMALE>: OK.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WILSON>: -- number of governorships that are up --\n",
      "<SPEAKER: UNIDENTIFIED MALE>: Right.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: WILSON>: -- in 2018. Democrats did horribly in 2010, in 2014 in those governorships. If they win back those seats and then seats in the State Houses around the country, they're going to have a foot most importantly in the door -- in the redistricting process which happens in 2020. That's a lot of thinking out to do about a process that's two, four, six years down the line. You know, I'm not sure that the people protesting outside Chuck Schumer's apartment in New York City are going to be thinking that far ahead.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: KING>: It is a reminder for those of us who live in Washington, and this is part of the recipe of Donald Trump's victory. Pay attention on what's happening out on the states, not just what's happening here in Washington. Up next, President Trump says why he wants to keep American safe from terror. The media is covering up attacks.\n",

      "<SPEAKER: ROWLANDS>: Do you have a question?\n",
      "<SPEAKER: ROWLANDS>: Tamika grew up in one of Chicago's notorious public housing projects where kids often ended up going to jail rather than college. Tamika's mother was a drug addict, so her grandmother raised all four kids.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: BETHEL>: It was you need to be in bed to sleep at this time. You need to be up getting ready for school at this time. She had the schedule when four of us take showers, when homework needed to be done and what chores to do.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: ROWLANDS>: After attending public school through eighth grade, Tamika won a scholarship to attend Parker high school, a private school in high priced Lincoln Park. It took 90 minutes, two buses, and a train one way to get there. For four years, Tamika traveled back and forth between these two opposite worlds, getting straight A's.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: BETHEL>: I walked right to the bus stop and back to my house every day.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: ROWLANDS>: The public housing project where Tamika grew up is now in an open field that fenced off. It was demolished by the city of Chicago along with other projects in an effort to make the city safer.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: BETHEL>: We did not go outside. We didn't do the things that other kids did. And that was my grandmother's way of keeping us safe.\n",

Two days ago, the U.S. Embassy in Kenya warned that an attack could be imminent following threats from Al Shabab militants in Somalia. Robert Nagila from affiliate NTV spoke to us a short while ago.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: ROBERT NAGLIA, JOURNALIST>: If it is Al Shabab, that would mean a change of tactics, according to a lot of experts on the ground here, because a lot of people were expecting then to target high profile installations. This would then mean that Al Shabab has been unable to penetrate into the major areas because of the heavy security presence and it's now targeting so-called soft targets.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: VERJEE>: Rescue crews in Southeastern Turkey are desperately hunting for survivors in the wake of Sunday's powerful earthquake. They're searching the rubble of collapsed buildings, hoping to find people still alive after the deadly magnitude 7.2 quake. Medical aid and food are being trucked into Van. That's the largest city in the area devastated by the quake. But some villages are still unreachable. Diana Magnay is following the rescue efforts. She joins us now live from Van -- Diana, give us an idea of the latest on the rescue and recovery.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: DIANA MAGNAY, CNN CORRESPONDENT>: Hi, Zain. Well, I'm at a site in Van, where rescue workers believe that they do have two people still alive in the rubble down there, not because they actually heard their voice, but that they have other indications, apparently. So they are busily digging. You can see up there, they have some very heavy machinery they brought in the job a little earlier. And obviously this whole process starts with that moment where everybody just keeps very quiet and listens to see if there's any knocking or any cries or anything like that. And then they use these instruments to detect sound waves. They're bringing in the dogs. And here, they believe that they do have two people, so they're continuing to dig. And this is a scene which is kind of replicated in Van and in the other city of Ercis, which was badly affected by this earthquake and where I spent most the day today -- Zain.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: VERJEE>: Diana Magnay reporting. Syria has now recalled its U.S. ambassador for consultations after the U.S. pulled its ambassador out of Syria. American officials say that there are credible threats against Robert Ford's safety. Ford was attacked by what's described as a pro-government armed mob in Damascus last month. He's been a really outspoken critic of the Syrian government's crackdown on anti-regime protests. The man accused of plotting to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. has pleaded not guilty. Manssor Arbabsiar is accused of trying to hire hit men from a Mexican drug cartel to kill Ambassador Adel al-Jubeir in Washington. Prosecutors say the plot has ties to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Arbabsiar is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Jordan's King Abdullah swore in a new cabinet Monday, as the nation looks to speed up the pace of reforms in the wake of the Arab spring. In an exclusive interview with CNN, the king repeated his commitment to political reform. He told CNN's John Defterios that he wants to hold national elections next year.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: KING ABDULLAH, JORDAN>: -- if we're going from the Arab Spring to the Arab Summer. In other words, we need to roll up our -- our sleeves. And we have to get -- to get to national elections in 2012, we have to ratify 30 laws and amendments. So there's going to be tremendous work between the government and the parliament so that we can get ourselves in position for elections in 2012.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: JOHN DEFTERIOS, HOST, \"MARKETPLACE MIDDLE EAST\">: But some would say this is a knee-jerk reaction to the street. It's almost desperate, if you're going to change governments that quickly, that you're not letting a government settle in to get a -- a mandate to change laws.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: ABDULLAH>: I don't think it was a knee-jerk reaction. It's just if we're sincere about getting Jordan to national elections and a new phase of political life, you've got to get the right players. So this prime minister is coming in for a specific reason, so that we can achieve those ends.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: VERJEE>: Thailand's flood crisis is getting worse. That message from Thai authorities, who ordered evacuations in five more parts of Bangkok and say it's going to be weeks before waters recede. The Finance Ministry says the overall damage could top $6 billion. The disaster has already killed 356 people, with 113,000 living in shelters. Paula Hancocks has more from Bangkok.\n",
      "<SPEAKER: PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT>: Water is inching ever closer to Central Bangkok. This Monday, we've seen some buildings in the central business district start to put up sandbags around their entrances just in case. Authorities, though, do tell CNN that they're still confident that the central part of Bangkok can remain dry. That is little comfort, though, for those in the suburbs. We are seeing more suburbs in the north being submerged in water and more neighborhoods are having to be evacuated. Also, the Don Mueang domestic airport in Bangkok is starting to be surrounded by water, a meter of water in some areas there. Now, we have about 3,500 people that we've seen in tiny tents within the domestic airport, in the departures and the arrivals area. Authorities say that they won't be moving those evacuees anywhere, they are safe on the higher levels. But, ironically, this airport is also where the flood relief operations command is headquartered. They're considering whether or not they have to move out to try and keep the headquarters dry. Now, while water further north, we're being told by authorities, is actually starting to recede from the northern parts of Thailand, within Bangkok itself, the waters are still rising. The Chao Phraya River, which runs through the capital, is still rising. The next focus for authorities is next weekend and into early next week, when the high tides come back once again. Obviously, that will hamper some of the water flowing through the canals and through the rivers into the sea. As for time lines, we have been told by authorities they believe that it will be at least two weeks before we can see the situation start to improve. Some said it could be up to six weeks before the waters recede. Paula Hancocks, CNN, Bangkok.\n",

      "  \"Happening now, answering ISIS threats. The White House warns the terror group, \\\"If you come after Americans, we will come after you.\\\" But is the U.S. ready to take that fight beyond Iraq and into Syria? And ISIS warns America, we thirst for your blood. New details on the chilling e-mail sent to the family of a beheaded American. And I'll also speak with the lawmaker who represents the family of another ISIS hostage. And a new controversy in Ferguson. A St. Louis County Police officer who was involved in crowd control is relieved of duty after inflammatory statements. Wolf Blitzer is off tonight. I'm Brianna Keilar. You're in\",\n",
      "  \"Is the U.S. moving toward an all-out war with ISIS? The White House is making it clear that the brutal beheading of an American hostage will not go unanswered.\",\n",
      "  \"If you come after Americans, we're going to come after you wherever you are. And that's going to guide our planning in the days to come.\",\n",
      "  \"That comes a day after a stunning assessment from the Pentagon brass that the ISIS threat is, quote, \\\"beyond anything that we've seen.\\\" The generals made it clear that defeating ISIS would require going after the group inside Syria. We're looking at all angles of this chilling new threat, and we have the latest developments on the investigation of the fatal police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, including some significant details missing from the incident report. Our correspondents and guests are standing by with full coverage including Don Lemon and Jason Carroll in Ferguson. But we begin with CNN White House correspondent Michelle Kosinski. Michelle, tell us the latest on this ISIS threat.\",\n",
      "  \"Brianna, today, the president's deputy national security advisor agreed that the murder of James Foley is ISIS's first terrorist attack against the United States. And without stating it in so many words, he also said essentially that yes, the U.S. is considering air strikes in Syria, but he emphasized that that would require consultation with Congress, a legal justification for doing so.\",\n",
      "  \"Today's assessment of the ISI threat by the White House is serious.\",\n",
      "  \"It's not simply the threat they pose to the United States. It's the threat they pose to the entire world.\",\n",
      "  \"A big jump, though, this talk now about how to contain and ultimately defeat ISIS as the lives of other American hostages hang in the balance from January, when President Obama referred to such groups in an interview as a JV team when compared to al Qaeda. (on camera): Would you still agree with his assessment just a few months ago?\",\n",
      "  \"As they've become better funded through various funding streams, including what they're able to sell in terms of oil and gas, the ransoms they've been able to obtain, and that has developed their capacity in a way that has increased the threat. And they pose a greater threat today than they did six months ago and we're taking it very seriously.\",\n",
      "  \"The administration does agree, though, that ISIS is still mainly involved in regional operations, not the 9/11 level planning of al Qaeda. And today the Department of Homeland Security, FBI sent out a bulletin to law enforcement across America, saying, \\\"There is no credible homeland security threat linked to ISIS.\\\" But warns ISIS is using social media to try to gain followers and that it's urging acts of violence against, quote, \\\"American interests.\\\" And today, the White House would not go so far as to agree with Defense Secretary Hagel's words yesterday.\",\n",
      "  \"This is beyond anything that we've seen. So we must prepare for everything.\",\n",
      "  \"They abduct women and children and subject them to torture, rape and slavery. They have murdered Muslims, both Sunni and Shia, by the thousands. (on camera): So in those terms, is that beyond anything we've seen?\",\n",
      "  \"I -- the president has addressed this a little bit ago.\",\n",
      "  \"Does he agree with Secretary Hagel's assessment, though?\",\n",
      "  \"That what?\",\n",
      "  \"That this is beyond -- a threat beyond anything we've seen, or that ISIS is a force beyond anything we've seen?\",\n",
      "  \"I think how the president views ISIL has been articulated a couple times now.\",\n",
      "  \"The White House has also been saying that one reason ISIS has been able to gain strength, even over the last several months, is the payment of these enormous ransoms by several countries, including European nations. We know that the White House has put some pressure on those countries to stop that practice, but that some have been unwilling to do so. The White House today had some strong words against that, saying that it's the wrong policy, that it gives the terrorists perverse incentives for continuing with the kidnappings -- Brianna.\",\n",
      "  \"Great questioning today. Michelle Kosinski for us on Martha's Vineyard with the president. Thank you. Now, as ISIS and the United States trade public warnings, we are learning more about chilling e-mail exchanges the terror group had with the family of hostage Jim Foley. CNN's Brian Todd here with that. What did you find, Brian?\",\n",
      "  \"Brianna, we have new information tonight about those exchanges, and they are chilling indeed. The last e-mail the family received from his captors before James Foley was killed said, in part, \\\"We will not stop until we quench our thirst for your blood.\\\" It punctuated a series of communications between the two sides where the family appealed for mercy, and Foley's captors never seemed interested in that.\",\n",
      "  \"James Foley's family says they received six e-mails from his captors during the year and a half he was held. The militants at one point demanded more than $130 million for his release, according to the president of Global Post the news agency Foley worked for. Until last week, Foley's family had heard nothing for almost a year. Then an e-mail arrived, saying, \\\"He will be executed as a direct result of your transgressions towards us.\\\" Foley's parents had sent multiple messages to his captors, hoping to engage them. According to the president of Global Post, the family appealed to the captors to show mercy, saying James Foley was an innocent journalist and showed great empathy for the Syrian people. He says the family told the captors they had no control over the actions of the U.S. government. One expert says the family was right to engage the captors.\",\n",
      "  \"I would have said, \\\"Tell me what I can do. Ask me to do something that I can do. You're in charge. The decision for what happens to James is completely your decision. You're completely in charge. Give me something to do that I can do.\\\" And that is actually a great test to find out whether or not the other side is negotiating in good faith.\",\n",
      "  \"The Global Post CEO says he tried to raise money but says there was never any true negotiation between his news outlet and Foley's captors. Now new questions are emerging about the failed Special Operations raid to rescue Foley and other Americans. Pentagon officials say they revealed the mission, because several news outlets were about to report it. Some experts say that disclosure might compromise other rescue missions.\",\n",
      "  \"For one thing, any hostages in Syria now will be dispersed among several sites. They will be more heavily guarded. They may even be wired for demolition and death if -- if any sort of rescue attempt is made in the area.\",\n",
      "  \"In an interview with Yahoo! News, Foley's brother says he wishes the United States had done more.\",\n",
      "  \"You can accomplish both things. The United States could have done more on behalf of the western and American hostages over there and still, you know, dealt with the broader worldwide issue.\",\n",
      "  \"U.S. government officials say they use all the tools at their disposal to try to bring hostages home. They stressed to us they do not grant concessions to hostage takers. And under current U.S. law, paying ransoms would actually be illegal. But in reality, Brianna, no one has ever actually been prosecuted for paying a ransom to a terrorist group.\",\n",
      "  \"Now, ISIS reaches out. They reached out to the Foley family, but as you look at this, are you getting the sense that they were ever really serious about negotiating?\",\n",
      "  \"Experts have told us, and his boss has told us, they don't ever believe that they were ever serious about negotiation. The amount of money they demanded, $132 million, was just too unrealistic, really, for anyone to come up with. And even if they had come up with it, one expert told us they probably have kept moving the goal posts a little bit. Foley's boss did go on record as saying there was never really any true negotiation between his new outlet and the captors. Doesn't mean what happened was inevitable, but at least as far as negotiations, they don't believe they were ever serious.\",\n",
      "  \"All right. Brian Todd, thanks so much. Well, ISIS currently holds three Americans, including journalist Steven Sotloff, who was shown as the end of that horrifying ISIS murder video. And joining me now is Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida. She has been in touch with the members of the Sotloff family. They are residents in her district. Congresswoman, thanks for joining me.\",\n",
      "  \"Thank you so much, Brianna. But I do want to say that we have been helping on the case, along with Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and Congressman Ted Deutsch. But I have not had contact with the family for the last months.\",\n",
      "  \"OK.\",\n",
      "  \"They first contacted me this time last year. They're a very private family. They had not wanted any attention paid to this case. Why? Because they believed that a solution could be found. We had reached out to the Department of State, to the White House, to Reporters without Borders, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch. Any organization or agency that could help. And they were certainly very aware of the case. I had conversations with the White House as recently as yesterday. They are doing everything possible to make sure that Steven is returned to his wonderful parents. They're lovely people. And our community is praying for Steven Sotloff's life and also to give these wonderful parents the strength to continue with this ordeal.\",\n",
      "  \"How hard is it, Congresswoman, to try to make way on a negotiation, or not a negotiation but on trying to get Sotloff and these others released, if paying a ransom isn't on the table? What specifically is being done, besides reaching out to these human rights groups?\",\n",
      "  \"Well, I don't wish to speak for the Sotloff family, because they will be speaking at the proper time. They do live in my community.\",\n",
      "  \"I guess I mean, in general, if you can speak more generally.\",\n",
      "  \"Well, I would say -- I would that as a member of Congress, I would say never pay a ransom, because it only encourages further kidnapping. As a mother and as a grandmother, I would have a totally different response. I would say do everything humanly possible to return my son or my grandson to my loving arms. So this is a very grieving situation for them. I can't fathom how difficult it would be for them to be facing this terrible ordeal with not knowing and Steven's life in the hands of these murderers, barbarians. But we will pray, and as one of the family members said, there's a petition in Change.org. And they ask for people to sign the petition and to continue praying for Steven's life. But ISIS, heaven only knows what this group is capable of. As the mom said, he's still alive. So there's nothing to say.\",\n",
      "  \"Yes. They have reached out, ISIS has, to the Foley family, and we learned from the family that ISIS reached out on multiple occasions. Has ISIS reached out to the Sotloff family?\",\n",
      "  \"I do not know. We just know that they had received a telephone call from their son in December. I don't know, and I don't wish to become part of the Sotloff family saga, because that is a very private family, and they want their privacy to be respected. I can just say that they're a member of our community. We have tried to reach out through many government agencies and nongovernmental organizations. And it was -- it's very difficult to deal with a group that is totally out of control, but prayers for them all.\",\n",
      "  \"I wonder, General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs, he said that ISIS cannot be defeated without addressing the part of it that is in Syria. Do you support air strikes inside of Syria?\",\n",
      "  \"I do. I believe that the president should do that. I believe that he should have done it when he first announced it, when he said Assad has crossed a red line in the use of chemical weapons. In fact, they used chemical weapons twice, and still we did not do what we said we would do. So it was a mistake for us not to act then. Many of us were supportive of the president's actions. And then, when it comes to ISIS or ISIL in Iraq, what we have are natural allies, the Kurds. They're fighters. They want to defeat this horrible terrorist regime, and they will do so if we give them the arms to fight. And so I support limited air strikes, and furthermore, I support arming the Kurds so that they can take ISIL out. We cannot let this cancer grow.\",\n",
      "  \"Yes. And it sounds like arming the Kurds is obviously something very much on the table there. When you did listen to Dempsey's comments yesterday, did you take that? Did you read that? Do you get the sense that the administration will take this step of U.S. air strikes or certainly something U.S. and allies, air strikes in Syria?\",\n",
      "  \"Brianna, I do. I do believe that the administration is seriously considering that. And I think that by keeping Congress in the loop, keeping us informed and maybe even going a step further, getting authorization from the United States Congress, I believe that there are many members who feel the same way. My stepson and daughter-in-law served in Iraq. We know how hard it is for the military.\",\n",
      "  \"Do you think that would pass a Democratic Senate?\",\n",
      "  \"Well, one can only hope. ISIS a real threat. It's a threat to the entire area. It's a threat to democratic allies and our U.S. national security interests. We cannot wish it and hope it away. We need to eliminate this. Let's just first try limited air strikes and helping the Kurds without further involving U.S. troops on the ground. I think that we can beat these guys back, but doing nothing is not an option.\",\n",
      "  \"Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, thanks for joining us.\",\n",
      "  \"Thanks, Brianna.\",\n",
      "  \"Now, next breaking news. A stunning new development involving a police officer who was involved in crowd control in Ferguson, Missouri. We saw him in action live right here on CNN. We will tell you what we just learned about him and a controversial new video just surfaced.\"\n",

The local security forces, Becky, as you rightly point out, is a vexed issue. And I think the problem lies in part at least in the fact that the Hodeidah agreement as I know very well first-hand, didn't attempt to resolve the extraordinarily difficult issues of sovereignty in Yemen. Those issues will be resolved in a political solution. The Hodeidah agreement is a stopgap, the humanitarian stopgap, intended to improve the chances of the people of Yemen being able to survive the war. This has come down to a tug of war if you like over who's running the local security forces. The United Nations' role in this is by having the monitors and agencies on the ground to try to make sure that the security forces in both ports and city operate in a professional manner and maintain the security that is their mandate. So we will be there alongside them. I understand why many people in the government of Yemen say but we need to have these forces handed back to us. Well, that wasn't agreed in Sweden. I wish it had been. I hope it will be resolved when we get a political solution. It's my job to try and get an approach to this particular issue which doesn't create an impediment to the demilitarization that I referred to.\",\n",

In both cases, yes, there are interested parties particularly in the south and the pro government forces are dominated by Saudi air, a lot of UAE troops and Sudanese and so on, on the ground. In the Houthi areas, it really was not evident the presence of the Iranians. Nor do the Houthis particularly care to deny that they did get help from the Iranians. What they insisted upon was that they sought help wherever they could get it, the help was relatively small. We've seen some of the evidence in some of the missiles that the Iranians have helped improve. Some of the seaborne IEDs have been actually manufactured parts of them in Iran. But that the Houthis were very fiercely independent of the Iranians and everybody else. That's kind of what they're all about, trying to create this what they would describe as a pure version and uncorrupt vision as they would put it for the future of Yemen. So I think Mr. Griffiths is actually dead on when he says the whole talk of proxy, particularly right now in America, is somewhat exaggerated when it comes to the Houthis.\",\n",

We visited a cholera clinic in Hadja, which is basically a fairly middle-class looking town up in the mountains. It's a beautiful scenic place. There were children there and adult grown men facing cholera. There are pockets of extreme hunger but the word famine has actually been dropped completely from the lexicon. I spoke with some non-U.N. NGOs who said there are pockets of very extreme shortages of food but broadly across that area there is food. What there isn't is money. And the whole effort at the moment is focused and this is where there may be hope as Mr. Gargash is indicating there for a political breakthrough, because there is beginning to be an agreement and that's why Hodeidah is so important, between the two sides to agree to allow the distribution of government salaries both sides of the front line based on the 2014 payroll. Now if they can start getting money into the system, then they can actually see where the real cracks are. At the moment it's a humanitarian problem that could be solved fairly rapidly. That could usher in a political solution.\",\n",

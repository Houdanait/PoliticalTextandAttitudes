transcript:
Speaker 1: "In the run for the presidency."
Speaker 2: "I knew about one incident. Understand the whole time that he ran for office, I knew that he had had one liaison. It still -- it still tore me up, I mean, personally tore me up. Did I think that one liaison would disqualify him to be the president? You know, we've had great presidents who I would hope one liaison would not have -- have stopped from serving us. That's what I believed. And I believed that until, golly, <MAYBE> long after it made any sense to but, <CERTAINLY> long after -- I mean, long after he was out of the race. And so sometimes I had to, you know, bite my tongue. I talked a lot about his policies, which I still <BELIEVE> were the <BEST> policies and set the standard for the other candidates on a lot of issues -- health care being one of them, but environment and poverty and corporate interference with government. And I really believed that that I could talk about those things and mean every word that I was saying, and have him as an advocate for those issues and meaning that as well."

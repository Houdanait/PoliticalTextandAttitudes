* Can we identify the object of the hedging? (i.e. are they hedging about precision ("about 5:15" vs) or is it more meaningful? (i.e. "maybe this is a good idea"))


Ok so when we have same word, diff cosin similarity, can we identify the areas where they are the same/different? Then find words that match/differ on same dimensions?


If we do embeddinga ddition/subtraction of core elements between hdge and non-hedge, do we find anything similar?

i.e. 

vector_hedge_know = []
vector_none_know = []

dif = vhk - vnk

what's the similarity between that and other differences (i.e. does the subtraction represent the idea of hedging? If so, can we find that element in other words?)
